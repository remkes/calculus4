        Calculate the flux integral of <m>F(x,y,z) = (x,y^2,z^2)</m> 
        over the hollow rectangular prism <m>[-1,1] \times [-2,2]

        Calculate the flux integral of <m>F(x,y,z) = (x,y,-z)</m> 
        over the hemiphere <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</m> with <m>x \geq

        <m>(0,3,0)</m>. Assume there is a current density <m>J =
