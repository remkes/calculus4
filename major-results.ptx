  <title>The Major Results</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We we discussed the fundamental theorem of calculus earlier in these notes,
      we identified a particular archetypical style.
      <me>
        \int_{\del D} f = \int_D df
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <m>\del</m> is a boundary operator for sets and <m>df</m> is some kind of derivative of <m>f</m>.
      There are several very important theorems involving flux integrals which have this style.
      Before we state them,
      we have to talk a little about boundaries of sets and orientation.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="boundaries-orientation">
    <title>Boundaries and Orientation</title>
    <p>
      Topologically, we have already defined the boundary of a set.
      The boundaries we want to use are slightly different from the topological definition.
      Our sets here are parametric objects,
      so the boundaries are the edges in terms of the parameter.
      For curves, these were the endpoints,
      and the boundary integral was evaluation on the endpoints.
      However, evaluation on one endpoint was positive and the other was negative.
      These boundaries have orientation,
      which affects the integrals.
      For curves, orientation is direction and curves move from negative to positive.
      This gives the positive or negative signs for evaluation on the endpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      For surfaces,
      orientation is a choice of an outward or inward direction.
      It is indicated by the direction of the
      (outward facing)
      normal vector.
      If the surface has an edge,
      then we can think of the edge as a closed parametric curve;
      the curve traces the path around the edge.
      We need the direction of the curve and the orientation of the surface to compatible.
      This is accomplished by a right-hand-rule.
      If we trace the path around the surface,
      then the outward pointing normal of the surface must satisfy a right-hand-rule for this rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we have solid regions in <m>\RR^3</m>.
      By themselves, solid regions have no orentiation.
      However, solid regions have boundaries which are closed surfaces
      (surfaces without edges).
      By convention,
      we insist that the surface which bounds a solid region has an outward pointing normal:
      the normal points away from the region, not into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that on the objects discussed in this section,
      the boundary operator <m>\del</m> satisfies <m>\del^2 = 0</m>.
      If we have a solid region,
      its boundary is a closed surface,
      i.e., a surface with no boundary.
      If we have a surface, its boundary is a closed curved,
      i.e., a curve with no boundary.
      And the boundary of a curve is two points,
      which don't have boundaries for dimension reasons.

    <p>
      Now we can state the two main theorems for vector calculus.
      The theorems are stated for piece-wise smooth objects,
      which means we allow for some number of sharp corners.
      The first is called Stokes' Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sigma</m> be a piecewise-smooth oriented parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m>,
          with boundary <m>\del \sigma = \gamma</m> a piecewise smooth oriented closed curve.
          Let <m>F</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a neighbourhood of <m>\sigma</m>.
          <me>
            \int_{\del \sigma} F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times F) \cdot dA
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem has the desired form.
      We have a boundary on the left,
      and a differential operator (curl,
      in this case) on the right.
      The second result is called Gauss' Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a simply-connected region in <m>\RR^3</m> whose boundary
          <m>\del D = \sigma</m> is a piecewise smooth oriented closed parametric surface.
          Let <m>F</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a neighbourhood of <m>D</m>.
          <me>
            \int_{\del D} F \cdot dA = \int_D (\nabla \cdot F) dV
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem also has the desired form.
      We have a boundary on the left and a differential operator (divergence,
      in thic case) on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, there is a specialization of Stokes' thoerem for <m>\RR^2</m>,
      called Green's theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a simply-connected region in <m>\RR^2</m> and let
          <m>F = (F_1,F_2)</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a neightbourhood of <m>D</m>.
          We can interpret <m>\RR^2</m> as the <m>xy</m> plane in <m>\RR^3</m> and extend <m>F</m> as
          <m>F = (F_1,F_2,0)</m> as a vector field in <m>\RR^3</m>.
          We can interpret <m>D</m> as a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m> which is restricted to the <m>xy</m> plane,
          using <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as parameters and the identity function <m>D \rightarrow D</m> as <m>\sigma</m>.
          In this setting, we can apply Stokes' to get Green's theorem.
          <me>
            \int_{\del D} F \cdot ds = \int_D (\nabla \times F) \cdot dA = \int_D \left( \frac{\del F_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del F_1}{\del y} \right) dx dy
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Since these three named theorems are of similar form,
      they are often referred to as Gauss-Green-Stokes.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="gauss-green-stokes-examples">
    <title>Examples of Gauss-Green-Stokes</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's start in <m>\RR^2</m> with Green's theorem.
          Let <m>F(x,y) = (\sin x, x^2 y^3)</m> and let <m>\sigma</m> be the triangle with vertices <m>(0,0)</m>,
          <m>(2,0)</m> and <m>(2,2)</m>.
          Then <m>\gamma</m> is the path in three straight lines from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(2,0)</m> to <m>(2,2)</m> and back to <m>(0,0)</m>.
          (Now we see why we need piece-wise smooth conditions:
          allowing these sharp corners on the boundary path is very reasonable.)
          The line integral of <m>F</m> over <m>\gamma</m> could be calculated in three steps,
          by parametrizing each line segments and calculating those line integrals.
          Green's theorem gives us an alternate way to calcaulate the line integral.
          <md>

            <mrow>\amp  = 2 \int_0^2 \frac{x^5}{4} dx = \left. \frac{x^6}{12} \right|_0^2 = \frac{2^6}{12} = \frac{16}{3}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F = (\sin x^2, e^{y^2} + x^2, z^2 + 2x^2)</m> and let <m>\gamma</m> be the counterclockwise path around the triangle in <m>\RR^3</m> with vertices <m>(3,0,0)</m>,
          <m>(0,2,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,1)</m>.
          We could parametrize the three pieces of the triangle,
          but lets use Stokes' theorem with the triangle as the surface.
          The triangle is flat, so it may be parametrized with a constant normal.
          The equation of the plane containing the triangle is <m>\frac{x}{3} + \frac{y}{2} + z = 1</m>,
          with normal <m>\left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)</m>.
          The curl of <m>F</m>, after some algebra is
          <m>(0, -4x, 2x)</m>. (Here the curl is much easier to work with than the origianl <m>F</m>!) Then <m>\nabla \times F \cdot N = (0, -4x, 2x) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right) = 0</m>.
          This lets us treat the original
          (very complicated)
          line integral as a very straightforward surface integral.
          <me>
            \int_\gamma F \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA = \int_\sigma F \cdot N dA = \int_{\sigma} 0 dA = 0
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be any <m>C^1</m> vector field and let <m>\sigma = S^2</m>,
          the unit sphere in <m>\RR^3</m>.
          <me>
            \int_{\sigma} \nabla \times F = \int_{\del \sigma} F \cdot ds = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The last integral is zero because the sphere doesn't have any boundary.
          This is true for any closed surface: Stokes' theorem tells us that the integral of a curl over any closed surface must be zero.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We can ask: what does it mean to consider the flux of curl?
      If there is a positive flux of <m>\nabla \times F</m> through a surface,
      this indicates the (local) tendnecy of the flow to move in a counterclockwise rotation across the surface.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sigma(u,v) = (u,v,4-u^2-v^2)</m> for <m>(u,v)</m> in the disc about the origin of radius <m>2</m>,
          (<m>u^2 + v^2 \leq 4</m>).
          This <m>\sigma</m> is a parabaloid above the <m>xy</m> plane.
          Its bounding curve is the circle of radius <m>2</m> about the origin in the <m>xy</m> plane,
          going counterclockwise
          (to fit the upward normal of the surface with a right-hand-rule).
          The boundary curve is parametrized as <m>\gamma(t) = (2 \cos t, 2 \sin t, 0)</m>.
          Let <m>F(x,y,z) = (z^2, x^2, y^2)</m>.
          Then we can calculate the line integral of <m>F</m> over the boundary curve.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds \amp  = \int_0^{2\pi} F(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^{2\pi} (0, 4\cos^2 t, 4 \sin^2 t) \cdot (-2\sin t, 2\cos t, 0) dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^{2\pi} 8 \cos^3 t dt = \left. \frac{8}{3} (2 + \cos^2 2t) \sin t \right|_0^{2\pi} = 0</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This implies, by Stokes' theorem,
          a zero result about the surface integral of <m>\nabla \times F</m> over the parabaloid.
          <me>
            \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times F) \cdot dA = \int_{\sigma} (2y, 2z, 2x) \cdot dA = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          It we calculated the flux directly, it would be as follows.
          <md>
            <mrow>\sigma_u \amp  = (1,0, -2u)</mrow>
            <mrow>\sigma_v \amp  = (0,1, -2v)</mrow>
            <mrow>\sigma_u \times \sigma_v \amp  = (2u, 2v, 1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\nabla \times F \amp  = (8v, 8-2u^2-2v^2, 2u)</mrow>
            <mrow>\int_{\sigma} \nabla \times F \cdot dA \amp  = \int_D (4uv - 16 v - 4vu^2 - 4v^3 + 2u) du dv</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we already know this is zero,
          without doing the long polar coordinate integration.
          Curiously, this would be zero for <em>any</em>
          surface with this bounding curve <m>\gamma</m>.
          A cylinder closed at the top,
          a cone, a very complicated ballon; it doesn't matter.
          Only the boundary matters.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Similarly, lets say that we want to integrate
          <m>F = (z^2, y, xz)</m> over a closed curve <m>\gamma</m>.
          Stokes' theorem says we can calculate the integral of
          <m>\nabla \times F</m> over any surface with boundary <m>\gamma</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,z,0)</m>.
          But <m>\nabla \times (\frac{z^2}{2}, 0,0)</m> is also <m>(0,z,0)</m>.
          Look at Stokes' theorem for this case.
          <me>
            \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} \nabla \times F \cdot dA = \int_{\gamma} (\frac{z^2}{2}, 0, 0) \cdot dA
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can replace <m>F</m> with a much less complicated field and get the same line integral.
          This is true because <m>F</m> and this new field both give the same curl.
          We have some terminology to generalize this strange situation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> and <m>F</m> be <m>C^1</m> vectors fields with <m>G = \nabla \times F</m>.
          We call <m>F</m> a <term>vector potential</term> for <m>G</m>.
          If we need to differentiate between the two notion of potential,
          we will refer to the previous use of potential as
          <term>scalar potential</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The above argument shows that if <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m> are vector potentials for the same <m>F</m>,
      then they have equivalent line integrals over any closed curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we know if a field has a vector potential?
      For scalar potentials
      (on a simply connected set),
      we checked <m>\nabla \times F =0</m>.
      If <m>F = \nabla \times G</m> then <m>\nabla \cdot F = \nabla \cdot (\nabla) \times G = 0</m>.
      As with scalar potentials,
      under reasonable conditions, the inverse is true as well.
      A field has a vector potential
      (on a simply connected set)
      if it have zero divergence.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we find a vector potential?
      If we know <m>G</m> and we assume <m>\nabla \times F = G</m>,
      then we have to solve this system of three differential equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\del F_3}{\del y} - \frac{\del F^2}{\del z} \amp  = G_1</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del F_1}{\del z} - \frac{\del F^3}{\del x} \amp  = G_2</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del F_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del F^1}{\del y} \amp  = G_3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is usually prohibitively difficult.
      Moreover, this is a very underdetermined system.
      If <m>F</m> is a vector potential,
      then for any scalar field <m>f</m>,
      <m>F + \nabla f</m> is also a vector potential, because
      <me>
        \nabla \times (F + \nabla f) = \nabla \times F + \nabla \times \nabla f = \nabla \times F + (0,0,0) = \nabla \times F = G
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The inverse is true as well:
      if two have two vector potentials,
      they must differ by some <m>\nabla f</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          To do a tractable example, let's return to the previous field.
          Let <m>G = (0,z,0)</m>.
          <m>F_a = (z^2, y, xz)</m>,
          <m>F_b = \left( \frac{z^2}{2}, 0, 0 \right)</m> are both vector potentials for <m>G</m>.
          Their difference must be a conservative field.
          <me>
            F_a - F_b = \left( \frac{z^2}{x}, y, xz \right) = \nabla \left( \frac{xz^2}{2} + \frac{y^2}{2} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>\gamma</m> is any closed curve entirely in the <m>xy</m> plane,
          then since <m>F_b = 0</m> on the <m>xy</m> plane,
          we have a general vanish result about line integrals along <m>\gamma</m>.
          <me>
            \int_\gamma F_a \cdot ds = \int_\gamma F_b \cdot ds = \int_\gamma 0 \cdot ds = 0

          If <m>F = (z^2 + xy^2, \cos(x+z), e^{-y} + zy^2)</m>,
          then <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>,
          so <m>F</m> is incompressible.
          Then, if <m>D</m> is any solid region in <m>\RR^3</m> with boundary <m>\sigma</m>, Gauss' theorem gives us a vanishing result.

          That calculation means that the flux of an incompressible field over any closed surface is zero.
          The property of being incompressible means that equal amonts of the field flow in and flow out of any closed surface,
          no matter how complicated the geometry.

      Working with Stokes' theorem previously,
      we realized we could change line integrals over a closed curve by a conservative field and not alter the line integral.
      We can do the same over closed surfaces.
      Let <m>\sigma</m> be a closed surface and <m>F</m> any field.
      Recall that <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times G ) = 0</m>.
      The following calculation shows how we can alter the field <m>F</m> without changing the value of the flux integral.
      <me>
        \int_\sigma F \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot F dv = \int_D \nabla \cdot (F + \nabla \times G) dV = \int_{\sigma} (F + \nabla \times G) \cdot dA

          Consider a windsock which is the surface of revolution of the function
          <m>y = \sqrt{1 - \frac{x}{3}}</m> for <m>x \in [0,3]</m>,
          with outward oriented normal.
          Let <m>F = (7, -z, y)</m> be a field describing the wind near the windsock.
          What is the flux through the windsock?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we can check <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>,
          so <m>F</m> is incompressible and has a vector potential.
          Assume <m>F = \nabla \times G</m> for some vector potential <m>G</m>.
          If we call <m>D</m> the solid interior of the windsock,
          then the boundary of <m>D</m> is the windsock and the circle at its mouth.
          We label the circle <m>\mu</m> and consider it a parametric surface with normal in the
          <em>negative</em> <m>x</m> direction.
          Then we apply Gauss twice, once in each direction.
          <me>
            \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA = \int_{D} \nabla \cdot F dV - \int_\mu F \cdot dA = -\int_\mu F \cdot dA
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if <m>\gamma</m> is the boundary of the circle,
          we have the following calculation using Stokes' theorem
          (with the negative sign accounting for the change in direction of the normal).
          <me>
            \int_\sigma F \cdot dA = \int_\gamma G \cdot ds = -\int_\mu F \cdot dA
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Very curiuosly,
          both Stokes' and Gauss' give the same assistance here.
          In any case,
          we can replace our surface with a much easier surface:
          a disc of radius <m>1</m> in the <m>yz</m> plane,
          parametrized as <m>\mu(r,\theta) = (0, r\cos \theta,
          r \sin \theta)</m> for <m>r \in [0,1]</m> and <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi]</m>.
          We calculate the flux,
          reversing the conventional order of the cross product to account for the normal in the negative <m>x</m> direction.

          This is an incompressible field over a closed surface,
          so it has zero flux.

          Let <m>F = (y, z e^{y^2}, x + z^2 e^{z^2})</m> and let <m>\gamma</m> be the semicirlce from
          <m>(-3,0,0)</m> to <m>(3,0,0)</m> which lies in the positive <m>y</m> part of the <m>xy</m>plane.
          What is the line integral?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we can check that <m>\nabla \times F = (-1,1,0)</m>,
          so the field is not conservative.
          However, let's also consider the path <m>\delta</m> from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to
          <m>(-3,0,0)</m> along the <m>x</m> axis.
          Then <m>\gamma</m> followed by <m>\delta</m> is a closed path which is the boundary of the half-circle of radius <m>3</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane.
          Call the half circle <m>\sigma</m>.
          We apply Stokes' theorem.
          <me>
            \int_{\gamma + \delta} F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times F) \cdot dA
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can solve for the original line integral.
          <me>
            \int_\gamma F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times F) \cdot dA - \int_\delta F \cdot ds
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          These two integrals on the right are notably easier than the first integral.
          <m>\delta</m> is entirely on the <m>x</m> axis,
          so <m>F = (0,0,x)</m> when <m>y = z = 0</m>.
          The tangent to <m>\delta</m> is <m>(1,0,0)</m> so <m>F \cdot N = 0</m>,
          which means the second integral vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal to <m>\sigma</m> is <m>(0,0,-1)</m>,
          pointing in the negative <m>z</m> direction to match orientation.
          <m>(\nabla \times F) \cdot N = (-1,1,0) \cdot (0,0,-1) = 0</m>,
          so the first integral vanishes.
          Therefore, our original line integral also vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the field is not conservative,
          so a different path from <m>(-3,0,0)</m> to <m>(3,0,0)</m> might have a different value.
          If we worked in the <m>xz</m> plane instead of the <m>xy</m> plane with the same setup,
          the second integral would still vanish but the normal to <m>\sigma</m> would be <m>(0,-1,0)</m>,
          so <m>(\nabla \times F) \cdot N = (-1)</m> and the value of the first integral would be non-zero.
          <me>
            \int_\sigma -1 dA = - \frac{9\pi}{2} \implies \int_\gamma F \cdot ds = \frac{-9\pi}{2}
