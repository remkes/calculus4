  <title>Manifolds and Coordinate Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The major goal of this chapter is to explain the underlying structure behind Gauss-Green-Stokes and the fundamental theorem of calculus.
      By defining objects called <em>differential forms</em>,
      we can reduce all these theorems to one elegant statment.
      Differential forms arise in doing calculus on manifolds and the study of that calculus is called differential geometry,
      so this section is an introduction to differential geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we start with a geometric object: the manifold.
      In this course and in previous courses,
      we've worked with parametric curves and surfaces.
      Manifolds are a generalization of parametric objects.
      The major novelty of manifolds is that we allow different parts of the manifolds to have different parametrizations,
      as long the parametrizations cooperate where they overlap.
      We'll use parametric curves and surfaces to motivate our definition of manifolds,
      and then we'll worry about what it means for different parametrizations to cooperate on overlaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a core motivating example, consider the sphere.
      We parametrized the unit sphere as <m>\sigma(\theta,\phi) = (\sin \phi \cos \theta, \sin \phi \sin \theta, \cos \phi)</m>.
      This was a good parametrization,
      but it had problems at the poles,
      where <m>\theta</m> was no longer defined.
      We ignored these problems when we were doing integrals,
      since the isolated points didn't effect the value of the integral.
      However, we can't ingore the problem forever;
      there are operations where the poles present a real problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix this, we might try to rework the parametrization,
      but we would find that <em>any</em>
      parametrization of the sphere will have at least one point with this polar problem.
      To fully allow calculus on the sphere,
      we have to use different different parametrization for different regions.
      The sphere is thus one of the first and most important manifolds in differential geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can understand the problems of parametrization in terms of coordinate lines.
      At most points on the sphere, the coordinate lines
      (looking very locally)
      resemble the coordinates lines of <m>\RR^2</m>: a grid.
      However, at the poles,
      the coordinate lines look like rays and concentric circles.
      For manifolds,
      we seek local parametrizations where the coordinate lines always look like a grid.
      This will lead us to a formal definition,
      but first we need to do some topology.

    <title>Some Topology</title>
    <p>
      We previously defined open and closed set in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      A method of distinguishing open sets is called a <em>topology</em>,
      so we have a topology on <m>\RR^n</m>.
      Now, we also need to know the topology of any subset.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>.
          Let <m>U \subset S</m>.
          We say that <m>U</m> is an <term>open set in <m>S</m></term>
          if there exists an open set
          <m>V \subset \RR^n</m> such that <m>U = V \cap S</m>.
          Stated less formally,
          the open sets of <m>S</m> are exactly the intersections of the open sets of <m>\RR^n</m> with <m>S</m>.
          As with any topology,
          the closed sets of <m>S</m> are the complements of the open sets.
          This system of open sets on <m>S</m> is called the
          <term>subspace topology</term> on <m>S</m>.

          Let <m>M \subset \RR^n</m> be a connected subset.
          <m>M</m> is called a <term>(differentiable) manifold of dimension <m>k</m></term>
          if there is an open cover <m>U_i, \ i \in I</m> of <m>M</m> and,
          for each <m>U_i</m>,
          an invertible <m>C^1</m> function
          <m>\phi: D_i \rightarrow U</m> defined on a simply connected open domain <m>D_i \subset \RR^k</m>.
          This is the basic definition,
          but there are a number of associated terms and definitions.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The sets <m>U_i</m> in the open cover are called <em>charts</em>
                and the collection of all of them is called an <em>atlas</em>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The functions <m>\phi_i</m> are called the
                <em>coordinate functions</em> of the manifold.

              <p>
                The number <m>k</m> must be the same for all the charts and coordinate functions.
                It is called the <em>dimension</em> of the manifold.

                We could insist that the coordinate function are in a class <m>C^k</m> for a stronger definition.
                If we insist that the coordinate function are <m>C^{\infty}</m>,
                we call the object a <em>smooth manifold</em>.

    <p>
      The functions <m>\phi_i</m> are called a coordinate functions because they allow us to use the variables
      <m>u_j \in D_i</m> as coordinates (equivalently,
      parameters) on the manifold.
      The functions <m>\phi_i</m> are indeed parametrizations as we previously understood them:
      the situation is the same as
      <m>\gamma(t)</m> for a curve which lets us use <m>t</m> as a parameter;
      or <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> for a surface which lets us use <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> as parameters.
      The only difference, now,
      is that the parametrization doesn't need to apply to the whole object.
      We allow different parametrizations for different portions of the manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that for parametric curves and surfaces,
      all of the calculus is done in the parameters.
      For curves, we defined tangents, normals, binormals,
      length integrals and line integrals all in the variable <m>t</m>.
      For parametric surfaces, we defined normals, area,
      scalar field integrals and flux integrals all in terms of the variales <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
      The same is true for manifolds.
      The coordinate functions let use the coordinate variables from the open sets <m>D_i</m> to do calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we've done so far for parametric curves and surfaces can be extended to manifolds.
      There real challenge, though,
      is multiple charts, each with its own parametrization.
      The difficult reality with manifolds is that we have to make sure that the various results
      <em>agree with each other</em>
      on the overlaps of the charts.
      To help that out, we have one last definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a differentiable manifold with an atlas
          <m>U_i \ i \in I</m> and coordinate function <m>\phi_i</m>.
          On every non-empty intersection <m>A = U_i \cap U_j</m> for any pair
          <m>i,j \in I</m> with <m>i \neq j</m>,
          the function <m>\phi_i^{-1} \circ \phi_j: \phi_j^{-1}(A) \rightarrow \phi_i^{-1}(A)</m> is an invertible <m>C^1</m> function between subsets of <m>\RR^k</m>.
          It must be <m>C^1</m> because it is a composition of <m>C^1</m> functions.
          These compositions <m>\phi_i^{-1} \circ \phi_j</m> are called the
          <term>transition functions</term> of the manifold.
          (If we have a smooth manifold,
          the transition function are <m>C^{\infty}</m> functions.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The transition functions will help us understand how calculations for the manifold agree on the overlapping charts.

          The sphere of radius <m>r</m> with the parametrization from <xref ref="example-sphere-parametrization">Example</xref> is <em>not</em>
          a manifold, as we discussed earlier,
          since the parametrization doesn't work properly at the poles.
          How do we make it a manifold?
          We can make a atlas of two charts.

                Let <m>U_1</m> be the subset of the sphere without the two poles (the points <m>(0,0,r)</m> and
                <m>(0,0,-r)</m> and without the arc between the poles in the positive <m>x</m> half of the <m>xz</m> plane.
                For this parts of the sphere,
                we can use the standard parametrization as a coordinate function.
                <me>
                  \phi_1: (u,v) = (r\sin u \cos v, r\sin u \sin v, r\cos u)
                </me>
                The domain <m>D_1</m> of this coordinate function is<m>(u,v) \in (0,\pi) \times (0,2\pi)</m>.
                (Note the open brackets in this domains,
                so that it is an open subset of <m>\RR^2</m>.)

                Let <m>U_2</m> be the subset of the sphere without the two points <m>(0,r,0)</m> and
                <m>(0,-r,0)</m> and without the arc connecting these two points in the negative <m>x</m> half of the <m>xy</m> plane.
                For this part of ther sphere,
                we can do the same lattitude/longitutde parametrization as if these points were the two poles.
                That gives us a new a coordinate functon.

          These two charts <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> entirely cover the sphere.
          On each chart, <m>\phi_i</m> is an invertible,
          differentiable map from an open set of <m>\RR^2</m>.
          This is a manifold.

          Since there are only two charts,
          there is just one transition function:
          <m>T = \phi_1^{-1} \circ \phi_2</m>.
          (Technically, we could say there are two transition functions,
          since we also have <m>T^{-1}</m> going back.)
          We can calculate the inverse of <m>\phi_1</m> with some trigonometry.
          <me>
            \phi_1^{-1} (x,y,z) = \left( \arctan \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}, \arctan \frac{y}{x} \right)

        </p>
        <p>
          There is a subtlety here with the second component arctangent;
          we need an adjusted version of this inverse that make sense in all quandrants and works when <m>y= 0</m>,
          but this adjusted version can be constructed as a piecewise differentiable function.
          The composiiton of this <m>\phi_1^{-1}</m> with <m>\phi_2</m> gives the transition function. (I've not worked out the details,
          which are a bit annoying.)

          For any manifold,
          there are many different possible choices of charts and atlases.
          For the sphere,
          we'll construct a different set of charts to illustrate this variation.
          Consider this coordinate function.

          By permuting the coordinates and changing the sign of the square root term,

          These six charts completely cover the sphere, but no five of them do.
          Some of the charts,
          such as <m>\phi_1</m> and <m>\phi_2</m> do not overlap at all.
          Some of the charts,
          such as <m>\phi_1</m> and <m>\phi_3</m> overlap on an open quarter of the sphere.
          The inverse functions are pleasant here:
          for example, <m>\phi_1^{-1}(x,y,z) = (x,y)</m>.
          The transition functions, then,
          are also relatively reasonable.
          Here is one example.
          <me>
            \phi_1^{-1} \circ \phi_3(u,v) = (u, \sqrt{r^2-u^2-v^2}) \hspace{1cm} (u,v) \in D(0,r) \cap \{ x \lt  0 \}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though there are six charts here,
          this may be a better atlas to work with for the sphere,
          since the transition functions are much more reasonable than the previous example.

          The torus is another manifold where one chart is insufficient,
          even though there exists a full parametrization as a surface.
          Here is the parametrization,
          where <m>a</m> is the larger radius of the torus and <m>b</m> is the smaller radius.
          <me>
            \sigma(u,v) = ((a + b \cos v) \cos u, (a + b \cos v) \sin u + , b \sin v)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a full parametrization of the torus.
          It doesn't have the problem of poles;
          all the local coordinates look like grids.
          However, it does have a domain problem:
          the domain for the parameters is
          <m>[0, 2\pi) \times [0,2\pi)</m>, which is a closed set.
          To define this as a manifold,
          we take the exact same parametrization,
          but on four different domains.
          There are multiple choices for these domiains,
          but they have to overlap to cover the whole torus.
          A reasonable choice is these four domains:
          <m>(0,2\pi) \times (0,2\pi)</m>,
          <m>(0,2\pi) \times (\pi,3\pi)</m>,

          Each of these charts is missing only one value of each angle,
          which leads to the torus missing one horizontal circle and one vertical circle.

          These functions are exactly the same where they overlap.
          Therefore, the transition functions should be identity functions.
          Here is one example.

          Using these coordinate functions,
          we can think of the torus as these four squares in <m>\RR^2</m> pasted together along their overlap.
          That leads us to thinking of the torus as a single square
          <m>[0,2\pi] \times [0,2\pi]</m> where going off one side loops around to the other side.

          An important manifold in mathematical and physical history is
          <em>Minkowski Space</em>,
          which is the ambient space-time domain for special relativity.
          It's not a very interesting manifold for the purposes of this chapter:
          it is just <m>\RR^4</m> with one chart for the whole space (and variables <m>(x,y,z,t)</m>).
          However, it has a strange notion of distance (a notion of distance is called a
          <em>metric</em> in manifold theory).
          The <sq>length</sq> of a vector
          <m>(x,y,y,t)</m> is <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2}</m>.
          The relitavistic time dialation of distance is built into the manifold structure.

        <p>
          The more radically curved space-time of general relativity is also a manifold,
          and one that usually needs several charts.
          Since these manifold are the <em>ambient spaces</em> for physics,
          hopefully it becomes clear that we need to do calculus <em>on manifolds</em>.

    <title>Manifolds with Boundary</title>
    <p>
      Like parametric curves and surfaces,
      manifolds can be closed or open and can have boundaries.
      Informally speaking,
      boundaries happen at the edge of a chart where there isn't an overlap with another chart.
      Not all manifolds have well behaved boundaries,
      but we will restrict ourselves to manifold where the boundaries are reasonable:
      we want boundaries to be either empty or are themselves (piecewise) manifolds of one lower dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our reasonable manifolds,
      boundaries will parallel what we saw before for parametric objects.
      For curves, the boundary is the endpoints of the curve.
      For surfaces,
      the bounadry is a (piecewise) curve which goes around the edge of an open surface.
      For higher dimensional manifolds,
      the same intuition extends.
      In every case, though,
      the boundary is of a lower dimension than the manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      By allowing piecewsie boundaries,
      we include manifolds where the boundaries can have some sharp corners.
      Consider the solid cube, as an open set in <m>\RR^3</m>
      (and thus a manifold with one chart and the identity function as the coordinate function).
      The boundary of the cube consists of six solid squares.
      Each square, inside its edges, is a manifold itself
      (as a parametric surface, at least).
      We're alright with the situation that the boundary of the cube consists of <em>six</em>
      individual manifolds instead of one.

  <subsection xml:id="manifold-orientation">
    <title>Orientation on Manifolds</title>
    <p>
      Simple topological boundaries, however,
      are not enough for the theorems that we wish to establish.
      We need boundaries that consider orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orientation essentially works as it did before with parametric objects.
      A curve has an orientation given by a direction of movement along the curve.
      This still works with multiple charts,
      as long as the orientations agree on the overlaps.
      A surface has an orientation given by the direction of a normal
      (naively: above or below the surface).
      This still works with multiple charts,
      as long as the orientations agree on the overlaps.
      This notion of orientation extends to higher dimension manifold in ways that I will not describe in these notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boundaries, then, must have compatible orientations.
      The boundary of a curve is two points,
      with the starting points labelled as positive and the ending point laelled as negative.
      The boundary of a surface is a curve
      (or collection of curves)
      such that a right-hand-rule relates the direction of the curve and the direction of the normal.
      The boundary of a solid region in <m>\RR^3</m> is a collection of surfaces with normals that point outwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we did in the previous chapter,
      we use the symbol <m>\del</m> to indicate an oriented topological boundary.
      If <m>M</m> is a manifold, its boundary is written <m>\del M</m>.
      Orientation lead to one very important result.
      <me>
        \del (\del M) = \emptyset
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For a solid region, the boundary is a collection of surface.
      These surface may meet at their boundaries,
      but with opposite directions due to the outward facing normals.
      These opposite directions cancel out these boundary curves,
      leaving no boundary.
      For a surface, the boundary is a closed curve,
      with the same starting and ending points.
      Since the same point is labelled both positive and negative,
      this cancels out and the boundary is empty.
