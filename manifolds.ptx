  <title>Manifolds and Coordinate Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The major goal of this chapter is to explain the underlying
      structure behind Gauss-Green-Stokes and the fundamental theorem
      of calculus. By defining objects called <em>differential
      forms</em>, we can reduce all these theorems to one elegant
      statment. Differential forms arise in doing calculus on
      manifolds and the study of that calculus is called differential
      geometry, so this section is an introduction to differential
      geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we start with a geometric object: the manifold. In this
      course and in previous courses, we've worked with parametric
      curves and surfaces. Manifolds are a generalization of
      parametric objects. The major novelty of manifolds is that we
      allow different parts of the manifolds to have different
      parametrizations, as long the parametrizations cooperate where
      they overlap. We'll use parametric curves and surfaces to
      motivate our definition of manifolds, and then we'll worry about
      what it means for different parametrizations to cooperate on
      overlaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a core motivating example, consider the sphere. We
      parametrized the unit sphere as <m>\sigma(\theta,\phi) = (\sin
      \phi \cos \theta, \sin \phi \sin \theta, \cos \phi)</m>. This
      was a good parametrization, but it had problems at the poles,
      where <m>\theta</m> was no longer defined. We ignored these
      problems when we were doing integrals, since the isolated points
      didn't effect the value of the integral. However, we can't
      ingore the problem forever; there are operations where the poles
      present a real problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix this, we might try to rework the parametrization, but we
      would find that <em>any</em> parametrization of the sphere will
      have at least one point with this polar problem. To fully allow
      calculus on the sphere, we have to use different different
      parametrization for different regions. The sphere is thus one
      of the first and most important manifolds in differential
      geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can understand the problems of parametrization in terms of
      coordinate lines. At most points on the sphere, the coordinate
      lines (looking very locally) resemble the coordinates lines of
      <m>\RR^2</m>: a grid. However, at the poles, the coordinate
      lines look like rays and concentric circles. For manifolds, we
      seek local parametrizations where the coordinate lines always
      look like a grid. This will lead us to a formal definition, but
      first we need to do some topology.

    <title>Some Topology</title>
    <p>
      We previously defined open and closed set in <m>\RR^n</m>. A
      method of distinguishing open sets is called a
      <em>topology</em>, so we have a topology on <m>\RR^n</m>. Now,
      we also need to know the topology of any subset.

          there exists an open set <m>V \subset \RR^n</m> such that
          <m>U = V \cap S</m>. Stated less formally, the open sets of
          <m>S</m> are exactly the intersections of the open sets of
          <m>\RR^n</m> with <m>S</m>. As with any topology, the
          closed sets of <m>S</m> are the complements of the open
          sets. This system of open sets on <m>S</m> is called the
          <term>subspace topology</term> on <m>S</m>.

          Let <m>M \subset \RR^n</m> be a connected subset. <m>M</m>
          is called a <term>(differentiable) manifold of dimension
          <m>k</m></term> if there is an open cover <m>U_i, \ i \in
          I</m> of <m>M</m> and, for each <m>U_i</m>, an invertible

          on a simply connected open domain <m>D_i \subset \RR^k</m>.
          This is the basic definition, but there are a number of
          associated terms and definitions.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The sets <m>U_i</m> in the open cover are called
                <em>charts</em> and the collection of all of them is
                called an <em>atlas</em>.

                The functions <m>\phi_i</m> are called the

                The number <m>k</m> must be the same for all the
                charts and coordinate functions. It is called the

                A manifold of dimension one is called a

                We could insist that the coordinate function are in a
                class <m>C^k</m> for a stronger definition. If we
                insist that the coordinate function are
                <m>C^{\infty}</m>, we call the object a <em>smooth
                manifold</em>.

    <p>
      The functions <m>\phi_i</m> are called a coordinate functions
      because they allow us to use the variables <m>u_j \in D_i</m> as
      coordinates (equivalently, parameters) on the manifold. The
      functions <m>\phi_i</m> are indeed parametrizations as we
      previously understood them: the situation is the same as
      <m>\gamma(t)</m> for a curve which lets us use <m>t</m> as a
      parameter; or <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> for a surface which lets us use
      <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> as parameters. The only difference, now,
      is that the parametrization doesn't need to apply to the whole
      object. We allow different parametrizations for different
      portions of the manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that for parametric curves and surfaces, all of the
      calculus is done in the parameters. For curves, we defined
      tangents, normals, binormals, length integrals and line
      integrals all in the variable <m>t</m>. For parametric
      surfaces, we defined normals, area, scalar field integrals and
      flux integrals all in terms of the variales <m>u</m> and
      <m>v</m>. The same is true for manifolds. The coordinate
      functions let use the coordinate variables from the open sets
      <m>D_i</m> to do calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we've done so far for parametric curves and surfaces
      can be extended to manifolds. There real challenge, though, is
      multiple charts, each with its own parametrization. The
      difficult reality with manifolds is that we have to make sure
      that the various results <em>agree with each other</em> on the
      overlaps of the charts. To help that out, we have one last
      definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a differentiable manifold with an atlas
          <m>U_i \ i \in I</m> and coordinate function <m>\phi_i</m>.
          On every non-empty intersection <m>A = U_i \cap U_j</m> for
          any pair <m>i,j \in I</m> with <m>i \neq j</m>, the function
          <m>\phi_i^{-1} \circ \phi_j: \phi_j^{-1}(A) \rightarrow
          \phi_i^{-1}(A)</m> is an invertible <m>C^1</m> function
          between subsets of <m>\RR^k</m>. It must be <m>C^1</m>
          because it is a composition of <m>C^1</m> functions. These
          compositions <m>\phi_i^{-1} \circ \phi_j</m> are called the
          <term>transition functions</term> of the manifold. (If we
          have a smooth manifold, the transition function are
          <m>C^{\infty}</m> functions.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The transition functions will help us understand how
      calculations for the manifold agree on the overlapping charts.

          These six charts completely cover the sphere, but no five of
          them do. Some of the charts, such as <m>\phi_1</m> and
          <m>\phi_2</m> do not overlap at all. Some of the charts,
          such as <m>\phi_1</m> and <m>\phi_3</m> overlap on an open
          quarter of the sphere. The inverse functions are pleasant
          here: for example, <m>\phi_1^{-1}(x,y,z) = (x,y)</m>. The
          transition functions, then, are also relatively reasonable.
          Here is one example.

          Even though there are six charts here, this may be a better
          atlas to work with for the sphere, since the transition
          functions are much more reasonable than the previous
          example.

          The torus is another manifold where one chart is
          insufficient, even though there exists a full
          parametrization as a surface. Here is the parametrization,
          where <m>a</m> is the larger radius of the torus and
          <m>b</m> is the smaller radius.
          <me>
            \sigma(u,v) = ((a + b \cos v) \cos u, (a + b \cos v) \sin
            u + , b \sin v)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a full parametrization of the torus. It doesn't
          have the problem of poles; all the local coordinates look
          like grids. However, it does have a domain problem: the
          domain for the parameters is <m>[0, 2\pi) \times
          [0,2\pi)</m>, which is a closed set. To define this as a
          manifold, we take the exact same parametrization, but on
          four different domains. There are multiple choices for
          these domiains, but they have to overlap to cover the whole
          torus. A reasonable choice is these four domains:
          <m>(0,2\pi) \times (0,2\pi)</m>, <m>(0,2\pi) \times
          (\pi,3\pi)</m>, <m>(\pi, 3\pi) \times (0, 2\pi)</m> and
          <m>(3,\pi) \times (3,\pi)</m>. Each of these charts is
          missing only one value of each angle, which leads to the
          torus missing one horizontal circle and one vertical
          circle.

          These functions are exactly the same where they overlap.
          Therefore, the transition functions should be identity
          functions. Here is one example.
          <me>
            \phi_1 \circ \phi_2^{_1} = \Id (u,v) \in

        <p>
          Using these coordinate functions, we can think of the torus
          as these four squares in <m>\RR^2</m> pasted together along
          their overlap. That leads us to thinking of the torus as a
          single square <m>[0,2\pi] \times [0,2\pi]</m> where going
          off one side loops around to the other side.

          An important manifold in mathematical and physical history
          is <em>Minkowski Space</em>, which is the ambient space-time
          domain for special relativity. It's not a very interesting
          manifold for the purposes of this chapter: it is just
          <m>\RR^4</m> with one chart for the whole space (and
          variables <m>(x,y,z,t)</m>). However, it has a strange
          notion of distance (a notion of distance is called a
          <em>metric</em> in manifold theory). The <sq>length</sq> of
          a vector <m>(x,y,y,t)</m> is <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -
          t^2}</m>. The relitavistic time dialation of distance is
          built into the manifold structure.

          The more radically curved space-time of general relativity
          is also a manifold, and one that usually needs several
          charts. Since these manifold are the <em>ambient
          spaces</em> for physics, hopefully it becomes clear that we
          need to do calculus <em>on manifolds</em>.

    <title>Manifolds with Boundary</title>
    <p>
      Like parametric curves and surfaces, manifolds can be closed or
      open and can have boundaries. Informally speaking, boundaries
      happen at the edge of a chart where there isn't an overlap with
      another chart. Not all manifolds have well behaved boundaries,
      but we will restrict ourselves to manifold where the boundaries
      are reasonable: we want boundaries to be either empty or are
      themselves (piecewise) manifolds of one lower dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our reasonable manifolds, boundaries will parallel what we
      saw before for parametric objects. For curves, the boundary is
      the endpoints of the curve. For surfaces, the bounadry is a
      (piecewise) curve which goes around the edge of an open surface.
      For higher dimensional manifolds, the same intuition extends.
      In every case, though, the boundary is of a lower dimension than
      the manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      By allowing piecewsie boundaries, we include manifolds where the
      boundaries can have some sharp corners. Consider the solid
      cube, as an open set in <m>\RR^3</m> (and thus a manifold with
      one chart and the identity function as the coordinate function).
      The boundary of the cube consists of six solid squares. Each
      square, inside its edges, is a manifold itself (as a parametric
      surface, at least). We're alright with the situation that the
      boundary of the cube consists of <em>six</em> individual
      manifolds instead of one.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-manifold-orientation">
    <title>Orientation on Manifolds</title>
    <p>
      Simple topological boundaries, however, are not enough for the
      theorems that we wish to establish. We need boundaries that
      consider orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orientation essentially works as it did before with parametric
      objects. A curve has an orientation given by a direction of
      movement along the curve. This still works with multiple
      charts, as long as the orientations agree on the overlaps. A
      surface has an orientation given by the direction of a normal
      (naively: above or below the surface). This still works with
      multiple charts, as long as the orientations agree on the
      overlaps. This notion of orientation extends to higher
      dimension manifold in ways that I will not describe in these
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boundaries, then, must have compatible orientations. The
      boundary of a curve is two points, with the starting points
      labelled as positive and the ending point laelled as negative.
      The boundary of a surface is a curve (or collection of curves)
      such that a right-hand-rule relates the direction of the curve
      and the direction of the normal. The boundary of a solid region
      in <m>\RR^3</m> is a collection of surfaces with normals that
      point outwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we did in the previous chapter, we use the symbol <m>\del</m>
      to indicate an oriented topological boundary. If <m>M</m> is a
      manifold, its boundary is written <m>\del M</m>. Orientation
      lead to one very important result.
      <me>
        \del (\del M) = \emptyset
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For a solid region, the boundary is a collection of surface.
      These surface may meet at their boundaries, but with opposite
      directions due to the outward facing normals. These opposite
      directions cancel out these boundary curves, leaving no
      boundary. For a surface, the boundary is a closed curve, with
      the same starting and ending points. Since the same point is
      labelled both positive and negative, this cancels out and the
      boundary is empty.
