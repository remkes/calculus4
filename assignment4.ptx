        describe its orientation. (4)

        Construct a parametric description of a flag in the wind and
        describe its orientation. (Assume the flag has some kind of
        shape due to the flapping in the wind -- not just a rectangle.
        Exactly what shape you choose is up to you.) (4)

        Construct a parametric description of a vase. (The type and
        style of vase is, again, up to you, but choose something a
        a little interesting, i.e, not just a cylinder.) (4)

      <p>
        Parametrize a torus with large radius <m>a</m> and small
        radius <m>b</m>. Use that parametrization to calculate the
        surface area of the torus. (8)

    <li>
      <p>
        Calculate the flux of the field <m>F = (-1,1,3x^2)</m> over
        the open cylinder with radius <m>3</m> about the <m>y</m> axis
        with <m>y \in [-1,3]</m>. (8)
