        Construct a parametric description of a lampshade  and
        describe the orientation you've chosen. (You can choose the
        shape of the lampshade within reason.) (6)

      <p>
        Construct a parametric description of a truncated sphere and
        describe the orientation you've chosen. (You can choose how
        much of the sphere to truncate.) (6)

        Calculate the flux of the field <m>F = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)</m>
        over the surface <m>z = x^2 + y^2</m> for <m>z \in [0,5]</m>.

        radius 1 centred at <m>(3,-2,-1)</m>. The sphere has outward

        lies above/below the interval <m>[0,1]\times[0,3]</m>in the
        <m>xy</m> plane. The normal points above the plane (so it has
        a positive <m>z</m> component). (5)

        Let <m>f</m> be a scalar field, <m>F</m> be a vector field,
        and <m>\sigma</m> be a parametric surface. Prove this
        identity. (3) 
        <me>
          \int_{\del \sigma} (fF) \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} \left(
