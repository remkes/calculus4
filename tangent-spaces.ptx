    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to define and access tangent spaces
      for manifolds. We will start by generalizing tangents of
      parametric objects. For a parametric curve <m>\gamma</m>, we
      calculated <m>\gamma^\prime</m>, which was the tangent vector (a
      local direction vector). All multiples of <m>\gamma^\prime</m>
      gave the tangent line to the curve. For a parametric surface
      <m>\sigma</m>, we calculated <m>\sigma_u</m> and <m>\sigma_v</m>
      (again, two local direction vectors). All linear combinations
      of <m>\sigma_u</m> and <m>\sigma_v</m> give a plane which is
      tangent to the surface. The cross product, of course, gave the
      normal to that tangent plane. In either case, we see that the
      tangents are given by derivatives of the parametrization
      functions. For manifolds, parametrization functions are now the
      coordinate functions, leading to this definition.

        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a manifold of dimension <m>k</m>. Let
          <m>D</m> be a simply connected open set in <m>\RR^k</m> with
          <m>\phi:D \rightarrow U</m> a coordinate function on
          <m>M</m>. Let <m>u_i</m> be the variables of <m>\RR^k</m>
          on the set <m>D</m>. For each <m>u_i</m>, the partial
          derivative <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m> is a
          <term>tangent vector</term> to the manifold (as a local
          direction vector at a point <m>\phi(u_1, u_2, \ldots,
          u_k)</m>). The <term>tangent space</term> <m>T_p</m> at a
          point <m>p \in U</m> is the span all of the tangent vectors
          <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m> where <m>i = 1, \ldots,
          k</m>.

    <title>Tangents as Differential Operators</title>
    <p>
      There is some strange but conventional notation for tangent
      vectors to manifolds. Using the conditions of the previous
      definition, instead of <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m>, we
      often simply write <m>\del_i</m> for the tangent vector. If we
      want to specify the point <m>p</m> on the manifold, we write
      <m>\del_i(p)</m>. Notice, in this definition, that the
      subscript <m>i</m> refers to the coordinates defined by the
      coordinate function <m>\phi</m>: the coordinate function is
      always implicit in tangent vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something a little deeper going on with this notation.
      Recall the notion of a directional derivative in Calculus III:
      for a scalar field on an open set in <m>\RR^n</m>, we can
      differentiate the scalar field in any local direction. The
      partial derivatives of a scalar field were nothing more than the
      directional derivatives in the directions where only one
      coordinate changed. In this sense, the directional derivative
      give <em>all</em> the possible derivative of scalar fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let <m>f</m> be a differentiable scalar field on a manifold
      <m>M</m>. According to <xref
      ref="def-differentiable-scalar-field" />, the
      composition <m>f \circ \phi</m> with any coordinate function
      must be a differentiable function on <m>D</m>, the domain of
      <m>\phi</m>. <m>D</m> has coordinate <m>u_i</m>, so we can take
      the derivative <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i} f \circ \phi</m>. These
      are the derivative of the scalar field on the manifold (at
      least, in this particular chart). Any linear combination of
      these partials is a <em>directional derivative</em> of
      <m>f</m>.
      <me>
        \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \frac{\del}{\del u_i} f \circ \phi
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This directional derivative is the derivative in the direction
      <m>\sum_{i=1}^k a_i \frac{\del}{\del u_i} \phi</m> on the
      manifold, which is a tangent direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this sense, we can think of tangent directions on the
      manifold as differential operators on scalar field, using the
      idea of a directional derivative. (Unlike the directional
      derivatives in Calculus III, we don't insist that the direction
      is a unit vector. Any non-zero vector still produces a
      differential operator.) This is a very common approch to
      tangents to manifold: instead of thinking of them geometrically
      as vector, we think of them as differentiable operators. This
      explains some of the notation: the basis differential operators
      are the partials <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i}</m>, which are
      succinctly written <m>\del_i</m>. This perspective will be very
      important for our work in future sections on making
      constructions agree on coordinate chart overlaps, where we can
      use the chain rule to understand how these differential
      operators change via transition functions.

      For parametric curves, we insisted that <m>\gamma^\prime(t) \neq
      0</m>. Similarly, for parametric surfaces, we insisted on
      non-zero normals. In either case, we wanted to make sure the
      tangent spaces to the parametric objects were well defined and
      had the same dimension as the parametric object. For manifolds,
      we have a similar restriction.

        <p>
          A manifold <m>M</m> of dimension <m>k</m> is called
          <term>non-singular</term> if all of its tangent spaces
          <m>T_p</m> are vector spaces of dimension <m>k</m> (i.e.,
          copies of <m>\RR^k</m>).

    <p>
      Many definitions of manifolds assume the non-singular condition.
      Our definition also implicity guarantees non-singular manifolds,
      becaused we assumed the coordinate functions were <m>C^1</m>
      functions. Smooth manifolds are also non-singular. (There is
      some variance in the literature in the terminology here; in some
      contexts, smooth and non-singular are synonymous. I've chosen a
      particular convention for these notes where smooth is a stronger
      condition.)

          Evaluated at an <m>(u,v) \in D(0,r)</m>, these give two
          local tangent directions to the hemisphere, much like a
          parametric surface. On the overlap with <m>\phi_3</m>,
          there would be different local descriptions of the tangent
          vectors, but the tangent planes that they span would be the
