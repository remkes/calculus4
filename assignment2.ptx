        Consider two circles in <m>\RR^2</m>, the first centred at the
        origin with radius <m>a</m> and the second centred at
        <m>(0,b)</m> with radius <m>b</m>. Assume that <m>\frac{a}{2}
        \lt b \lt a</m>. Then the region of the second circle which
        falls outside the first circle is a crescent shape in
        <m>\RR^2</m>. In terms of the constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        calculate the area of such a crescent as a double integral.
        What happens, both geometrically and in terms of the
        integrals, when <m>b = \frac{a}{2}</m>? (8)

        Using a similar system to spherical coordinates, devise a
        system of coordinates <m>(r,\theta,\phi)</m> where setting the
        <m>r</m> variable as a constant <m>(r = r_0)</m> gives a scale
        copy of this ellipsoid, with <m>r=1</m> giving this exact
        ellipsoid. What is the Jacobian of such a system of
        coordinates? Use the coordinates to calculate the volume of
        the ellipsoid.
