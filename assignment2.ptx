      <p>
        Let <m>D</m> be all of <m>\RR^2</m> excluding the unit disc.
        Integrate the function <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^4}</m> over
        thie region. (4)

    <li>
      <p>
        Consider a cylinder in <m>\RR^3</m>, centred around the
        <m>z</m> axis with height <m>z \in [0,5]</m> and radius
        <m>3</m>. Let <m>D</m> be exactly half of this cylinder where
        the <m>y</m> coordinate is positive. Integrate the function
        <m>f(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</m> over this region. (6)

    <li>
      <p>
        Let <m>D</m> be the region in <m>\RR^3</m> above the <m>xy</m>
        plane and below the parabaloid <m>z = 1 - x^2 - y^2</m>.
        Integrate the function <m>f(x,y,z) = x^4 - y^4</m> over this
        region. (6) 
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Find the volume of the portion of the solid sphere <m>x^2 +
        y^2 + z^2 = 16</m> which remains after removing the cylinder
        <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4</m>. (6) 
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Find the volume of the portion of the ellipsoid <m>4x^2 + 4y^2
        + z^2 = 64</m> which is below the plane <m>z=4</m>. (6) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Find a transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> that tranforms parabolae
        through <m>(0,0)</m> into straight lines. What is the Jacobian
        of the transformation? (6)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The cylindrical coordinates changes cylinders in <m>\RR^3</m>
        into equations of the form <m>r =</m> constant. Devise a
        coordinate system which changes cones with flare angle
        <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m> into equations <m>r =</m> constant. It is
        fine if you coordinate system only applies to the half of
        <m>\RR^3</m> where <m>z \geq 0</m>. Calculate the Jacobian of
        your transformation. (The flare angle of a cone is the angle
        between the slope of the cone and the vertical axis of the
        cone.) (6)

        <m>\rho(x,y) = \frac{1}{1 + b^2 x^2 + a^2 y^2}</m>. (6)

        uniformly dense solid surface of revolution formed by rotation
        <m>y(z) = \cos z</m> on <m>\left[ \frac{-\pi}{2},
        \frac{\pi}{2} \right]</m> about the <m>z</m> axis. (8)

    <li>
      <p>
        Find the centre of mass of a uniformly dense truncated sphere
        of radius <m>7</m> where the part of the sphere above the
        plane <m>z = 3</m> has been removed. (8)
