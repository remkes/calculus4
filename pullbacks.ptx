  <title>Pullbacks</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When we worked with parametric curves and parametric surfaces,
      there were two kinds of coordinates: coordinates in the
      parameter space (<m>t</m> for curves, <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> for
      surfaces) and coordinates in the ambient space (<m>x</m>,
      <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> in <m>\RR^3</m>). We needed to work with
      both sets of coordinates to property understand these parametric
      objects. In line and flux integrals, we had to evaluate the
      vector fields, given in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> ambient
      coordinates, in terms of the parameters, so that we could
      integrate in those parameters. We developed an interplay
      between the ambient coordinates and the parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>U</m> is an open set in a dimension <m>k</m> manifold in
      <m>\RR^n</m>, then we like have two sets of coordinates: local
      coordaintes (parameters) on the manifold <m>u_i</m> for <m>1
      \leq i \leq k</m> coming from the domain <m>D(0,r)</m> of a
      coordinate function; and the ambient coordinates <m>x_i</m> for
      <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>. In this section, we are
      going to build a general understanding of the interaction
      between the two sets of coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we work on a manifold under with dimensions <m>k</m>, the
      highest degree differential form on <m>U</m> is a k-form. In
      the local coordinates <m>u_1, \ldots, u_k</m>, this form is
      simply <m>f(u_1, \ldots, u_k) du_1 \wedge du_2 \wedge \ldots
      \wedge du_k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this form may also be expressed in terms of the ambient
      coordinates <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m>. (Note that <m>n \geq k</m>:
      there may be more of these coordinates than the parameters!) The
      form can be expressed in terms of wedges of <m>k</m> different
      <m>dx_i</m> in the ambient coordinates. For example, if
      <m>k=2</m> and <m>n=3</m>, then the two form could be <m>\omega
      = (x^2yz) dy \wedge dz</m> or <m>\omega = (x+y+z) dx \wedge
      dz</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, a k-form in the ambient coordinates can be a wedge
      of any subset consisting of exactly <m>k</m> of the <m>x_i</m>.
      <me>
        \omega_k = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) dx_{j_1} \wedge dx_{j_2}
        \wedge, \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For parametric curves and surfaces, we replaced the ambient
      coordinates with the parameters using the definition of the
      curves and surface. When we went to integrate, we used a
      Jacobian term to relate the integral of the ambient coordinates
      to the integral of the parameters. For the curve, that Jacobian
      was <m>|\gamma^\prime(t)|</m>, and for a surface, that Jacobian
      was <m>|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a manifold, we will do the same. We will replace the
      ambient coordinates with the local coordinates using the
      coordinate functions. This is a change of coordinates: ambient
      going to local. Since the local coordinates are the
      <em>domain</em> of the coordinate functions, this is sort-of
      going backwards with the coordinate functions. For this reason,
      we call the operation a <em>pullback</em> of the differential
      form. Like the curve and surface case, we will need a Jacobian
      for this pullback.

          be its local coordinates and <m>\phi: D \rightarrow U</m> is
          coordinate function. Let <m>\omega_k</m> be a differential
          k-form expressed in the ambient coordinates (where the
          <m>j_i</m> are any subset of exactly <m>k</m> of the ambient
          coordinates).

          The intermediate terms is the <term>Jacobian</term> of the
          pullback. It is defined as the determinant of a particular

      Note that these vertical lines indicate the <em>determinant</em>
      of the matrix, not the absolute value. We <em>do not</em> take
      absolute values for Jacobians anymore!

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-jacobians">
    <title>
      Jacobians, Orientation, Absolute Values and Differential Forms
    </title>
    <p>
      The fact that we don't have absolute values of Jacobians now,
      but we did before, deserves some special attention. This
      difference gets right to the heart of the use and importance of
      differential forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we defined single, double and triple integrals over
      intervals in <m>\RR^1</m>, <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>
      (respectively), we essentially did so <em>without regard for
      orientation</em>. Orientation, for regions of Euclidian space,
      is determined by the ordering of the variables (or,
      equivalently, by the relative positions of the positive axes to
      each other).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fubini's theorem (<xref ref="thm-fubini" />) said
      that we could interchange the order of integration, under some
      mild assumptions on the function, and still produce the same
      result. The reason this works is that our notion of
      area/volume/hypervolume, encoded in the terms <m>dxdy</m>,
      <m>dxdydz</m> and similar, didn't care about the order of
      variables. It makes sense that <m>dxdy</m> and <m>dydx</m> both
      encode area, the same way that the area of a rectangle of height
      <m>a</m> and width <m>b</m> can be either <m>a \times b</m> or
      <m>b \times a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in Euclidean space, we could get away with this
      convention, ignoring the order or variables, and use a naive
      understanding of area/volume/hypervolume. But, when we used a
      transformation of Euclidean space to change variables, there was
      an effect on area/volume/hypervolume. Since these quantities
      are, by definition, positive, this effect needed to be a
      positive effect. Therefore, we needed to take the absolute
      value of Jacobian, so we don't introduce a negative scaling
      effect. Multiplying area by <m>-2</m> doesn't make sense in
      this context.
    </p>
    <p>
      For integration on manifolds, we don't have the luxury of
      ignoring orientation. Since everything is a parametrized object
      and we can only do calculus on parametrized objects via the
      coordinate functions, we need to care about orientation. We
      need to know the directions of curve. We need to know where the
      normals to surfaces are pointing. If we interchange variables,
      <m>x \mapsto y</m> and <m>y \mapsto x</m>, then the orientation
      changes and we should get a negative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work with differential forms. In the way they are
      constructed, we naturally have <m>dx \wedge dy = -dy \wedge
      dx</m> instead of <m>dx dy = dy dx</m>. Orientation is
      <em>built-in</em> to the very roots of differential forms. If
      we integrate a differential form over an open set in Euclidean
      space, we need to care around the order of variables.
      Area/volume/hypervolume become oriented quantities, which change
      in sign when we change orientation. We also should expect that
      Jacobians can be positive and negative. Therefore, quite
      naturally, we never see absolute values of Jacobians when
      working with differential forms.

    <title>Pullbacks and Covariance</title>
    <p>
      After that detour on Jacobians, let me restate the pullback
      definition.
      <me>
        \phi^* \omega^k = \left(f \circ \phi(u_1, \ldots u_k) \right)
        \frac{\del(x_{j_1}, x_{j_2}, \ldots, x_{j_k})}{\del(u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_k)} du_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge du_k
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      These pullbacks are, essentially, changes of variables by the
      function <m>\phi</m>. The <m>x_{j_i}</m> are the components of
      the function <m>\phi</m> which gives those coordinates in terms
      of the new variables <m>u_i</m>. Compare this with the change
      of variables expression for differential forms via a transition
      function.
      <me>
        f_1((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del u}{\del s} du + \frac{\del
        u}{\del t} dv \right] + f_2((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del
        v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t} dt \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The composition in the function is with <m>T</m> and the matrix
      action that produced the terms in square brackets used the
      matrix <m>J(T)</m>. It's hard to see directly, but there is a
      parallel structure here. We compose with a function
      (<m>\phi</m> or <m>T</m>) and then we use a the Jacobian matrix
      (or its determinant) to adjust the basis. This differed from
      the transformation of vector fields, where we composed with
      <m>T</m> but used the Jacobian of <m>T^{-1}</m>, not <m>T</m>.
      We called differential forms <em>covariant</em> and vector
      fields <em>contravariant</em> for these reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pullback is a <em>covariant</em> operation. We can perform
      pullbacks on differential forms only because they are also
      covariant. We cannot pullback a vector field, because it is not
      covariant. If we try, the contravariant nature of the field and
      the covariant nature of the pullback will mess up the agreement
      on the overlaps of charts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For vector fields in Euclidean space, or on parametric curves
      and surface, we can get around this because we never need to use
      multiple charts. When we start using manifolds and have
      multiple charts, this difficulty suddenly arises. And now, to
      anticipate the next section, we are going to use the pullback
      operation to define integration of differential forms. Since
      the pullback doesn't work for a vector field on a general
      manifold, we can't define their integrals. The natural objects
      to integrate on a manifold are differential forms, not vector
      fields.
