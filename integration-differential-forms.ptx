  <title>Integration of Differential Forms</title>
  <p>
    Differential forms are built to serve as integrands.
    A major contention of differential geometry is that an differential form is the <em>only</em>
    object that should be integrated and that any previously defined integrations can be efficiently and clearly realized as the integrals of differential forms.
    The notation reflects this:
    the fact that the bases for forms uses the symbols <m>dx_i</m> is explicitly because these have always been part of the notation for integration.
    The differential terms <m>dx</m> in an integral have always been problematic:
    historically, they were infinitesimals,
    and they have lingered as a vestige in modern calculus.
    Differential forms finally give those pieces of notation proper,
    clear definitions in the moderm treatment of integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition of integration assumes we already know single-variable integral and multiple integral of scalar functions by way of iterated integrals as describe in <xref ref="integration">Chapter</xref>.
    This definition does not assume any previous definitions for integration of vector fields or integration over parametric surfaces.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\omega</m> is a k-form on <m>U</m>,
        an open set in a <m>k-</m>dimensional manifold.
        Let <m>u_1, \ldots, u_k</m> be local coordinates and let
        <m>x_1, \ldots,
        x_n</m> be ambient coordinates.
        We can write <m>\omega = f dx_{j_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}</m> in ambient coordinates.
        Let <m>\phi :D \rightarrow U</m> be a coordinate function.
        The integral of <m>\omega</m> over <m>U</m> is defined as the integral of the pullback of <m>\omega</m> over the domain of the coordinate function.
        <me>
          \int_U \omega = \int_U f dx_{j_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k} = \int_D \phi^* \omega du_1 \ldots du_l
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So we pullback to a simply connected set in <m>\RR^k</m> and do the integral there.
    The coefficient <m>\phi^* f(u_1, \ldots,
    u_k)</m> is just a scalar function,
    so the integral is just a multiple-integral of a scalar function.
    Notice that the wedge <m>dx_{j_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}</m> turns into
    <m>du_1 \ldots du_k</m> in the integral over <m>D</m>!
    We finally treat the differential terms <m>du</m> is integration properly:
    they are just differential forms written without the wedge product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's work this out in dimensions 1 and 2.
    In dimension 1, a manifold is locally a parametric curve and the coordinate function is <m>\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m>.
    We want to integrate a 1-form on <m>\gamma</m>,
    since the degree has to match the dimension.
    Such a form in ambient coordinates is <m>\omega = f_1 dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz</m>.
    Let's calculate the integral.
    <md>
      <mrow>\int_\gamma \omega \amp  = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int_{[a,b]} \left( f_1 \circ \gamma \frac{dx}{dt} dt + f_2 \circ \phi \frac{dy}{dt} dt + f_3 \circ \gamma \frac{dz}{dt} dt \right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) dt</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we treat the coefficient of the form as a vector field,
    we recover the integration forumla for line integrals of a vector field over parametric curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    In dimension 2, a manifold is locally a parametric surface and the coordinate function is
    <m>\sigma: D \rightarrow \RR^3</m> in variables <m>(u,v)</m>.
    We want to integrate a 2-form on <m>\sigma</m>,
    since the degree has to match the dimensions.
    Such a form can be written in ambient coordinates.
    <me>
      \omega = f_1 dy\wedge dz + f_2 dz\wedge dx + f_3 dx \wedge dy
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Its integral over a surface <m>\sigma</m> is the integral of the pullback over the parameter domain.
    <md>
      <mrow>\int_\sigma \omega \amp  = \int_D \sigma^* \omega</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int_D \left( f_1 \circ \sigma \frac{\del (y,z)}{\del (u,v)} + f_2 \circ \sigma \frac{\del (z,x)}{\del (u,v)} + f_3 \circ \sigma \frac{\del (x,y)}{\del (u,v)} \right) du \wedge dv</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int_D (f \circ \sigma) \cdot \left( \frac{dy}{dv} \frac{dz}{du} - \frac{dy}{du} \frac{dz}{dv}, \frac{dz}{dv} \frac{dx}{du} - \frac{dz}{du} \frac{dx}{dv}, \frac{dx}{dv} \frac{dy}{du} - \frac{dx}{du} \frac{dy}{dv} \right) du \wedge dv</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int_D f(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot (\sigma_u \times \sigma_v) du dv</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we treated the cooeficients of the differential form as a vector field,
    we recover the integration formula for the flux integral of a field over a parametric surfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way,
    the integration definition for differential forms recovers all the vector field integrals we defined
    (and any similar vector field integrals one might define in any higher dimensions).
    Differential geometry argues,
    based on the fact that we can recover all these integration definition and the covariant nature of differential forms,
    that differential forms are the proper elements for integration.
