  <title>Integration of Differential Forms</title>
  <p>
    Differential forms are built to serve as integrands. A major
    contention of differential geometry is that an differential form
    is the <em>only</em> object that should be integrated and that any
    previously defined integrations can be efficiently and clearly
    realized as the integrals of differential forms. The notation
    reflects this: the fact that the bases for forms uses the symbols
    <m>dx_i</m> is explicitly because these have always been part of
    the notation for integration. The differential terms <m>dx</m> in
    an integral have always been problematic: historically, they were
    infinitesimals, and they have lingered as a vestige in modern
    calculus. Differential forms finally give those pieces of
    notation proper, clear definitions in the moderm treatment of
    integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition of integration assumes we already know
    single-variable integral and multiple integral of scalar functions
    by way of iterated integrals as described in <xref
    ref="section-iterated-integrals" />. This definition does not assume
    any previous definitions for integration of vector fields or
    integration over parametric surfaces.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\omega</m> is a k-form on <m>U</m>, an open set in a
        <m>k-</m>dimensional manifold. Let <m>u_1, \ldots, u_k</m> be
        local coordinates and let <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m> be ambient
        coordinates. We can write <m>\omega = f dx_{j_1} \wedge
        \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}</m> in ambient coordinates. Let
        <m>\phi :D \rightarrow U</m> be a coordinate function. The
        integral of <m>\omega</m> over <m>U</m> is defined as the
        integral of the pullback of <m>\omega</m> over the domain of
        the coordinate function.
        <me>
          \int_U \omega = \int_U f dx_{j_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge
          dx_{j_k} = \int_D \phi^* \omega du_1 \ldots du_l
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So we pullback to a simply connected set in <m>\RR^k</m> and do
    the integral there. The coefficient <m>\phi^* f(u_1, \ldots,
    u_k)</m> is just a scalar function, so the integral is just a
    multiple-integral of a scalar function. Notice that the wedge
    <m>dx_{j_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}</m> turns into <m>du_1
    \ldots du_k</m> in the integral over <m>D</m>!  We finally treat
    the differential terms <m>du</m> is integration properly: they are
    just differential forms written without the wedge product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's work this out in dimensions 1 and 2. In dimension 1, a
    manifold is locally a parametric curve and the coordinate function
    is <m>\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m>. We want to integrate a
    1-form on <m>\gamma</m>, since the degree has to match the
    dimension. Such a form in ambient coordinates is <m>\omega = f_1
    dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz</m>. Let's calculate the integral.
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \int_\gamma \omega \amp = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_{[a,b]} \left( f_1 \circ \gamma \frac{dx}{dt} dt +
        f_2 \circ \phi \frac{dy}{dt} dt + f_3 \circ \gamma
        \frac{dz}{dt} dt \right)
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) dt
      </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we treat the coefficient of the form as a vector field, we
    recover the integration forumla for line integrals of a vector
    field over parametric curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    In dimension 2, a manifold is locally a parametric surface and the
    coordinate function is <m>\sigma: D \rightarrow \RR^3</m> in
    variables <m>(u,v)</m>. We want to integrate a 2-form on
    <m>\sigma</m>, since the degree has to match the dimensions. Such
    a form can be written in ambient coordinates.
    <me>
      \omega = f_1 dy\wedge dz + f_2 dz\wedge dx + f_3 dx \wedge dy
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Its integral over a surface <m>\sigma</m> is the integral of the
    pullback over the parameter domain.
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \int_\sigma \omega \amp = \int_D \sigma^* \omega
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_D \left( f_1 \circ \sigma \frac{\del (y,z)}{\del
        (u,v)} + f_2 \circ \sigma \frac{\del (z,x)}{\del (u,v)} + f_3
        \circ \sigma \frac{\del (x,y)}{\del (u,v)} \right) du \wedge
        dv
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_D (f \circ \sigma) \cdot \left( \frac{dy}{dv}
        \frac{dz}{du} - \frac{dy}{du} \frac{dz}{dv}, \frac{dz}{dv}
        \frac{dx}{du} - \frac{dz}{du} \frac{dx}{dv}, \frac{dx}{dv}
        \frac{dy}{du} - \frac{dx}{du} \frac{dy}{dv} \right) du \wedge
        dv
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_D f(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot (\sigma_u \times \sigma_v)
        du dv
      </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we treated the cooeficients of the differential form as a
    vector field, we recover the integration formula for the flux
    integral of a field over a parametric surfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way, the integration definition for differential forms
    recovers all the vector field integrals we defined (and any
    similar vector field integrals one might define in any higher
    dimensions). Differential geometry argues, based on the fact that
    we can recover all these integration definition and the covariant
    nature of differential forms, that differential forms are the
    proper elements for integration.
