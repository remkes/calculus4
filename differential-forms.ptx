  <title>Differential Forms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now we can start to define the main object of this chapter: the
      differential form. The definition is quite odd: be warned.
      However, we will be rewarded by the end of the chapter. We
      start with a little bit of linear algebra.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be a vector space over <m>\RR</m>. The
          <term>dual space</term> of <m>L</m> is the space of all
          linear functions <m>f: L \rightarrow \RR</m>. It is a
          linear space of the same dimension as <m>L</m> and is
          written <m>L^\vee</m>. If <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\}</m> is a
          basis for <m>L</m>, then the <term>dual basis</term> for
          <m>L^\vee</m> is the set of functions <m>f_i</m> such that
          <m>f_i(v_j) = \delta_{ij}</m>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Differential forms are classified by their degree, which is a
      non-negative integer. Instead of attempting a full definition,
      we will start with the lowest degree forms and work our way up,
      using some of this linear algebra language.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A degree <m>0</m> differential form (0-form) on a manifold
          <m>M</m> is just a scalar field on <m>M</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a manifold of dimension <m>k</m> and
          <m>\phi: D \rightarrow U</m> a coordinate functionon
          <m>M</m>. A degree <m>1</m> differential form (1-form) on
          the chart <m>U</m> is a function <m>\omega</m> defined on
          <m>U</m> as follows.
          <me>
            \omega: U \rightarrow \bigcup_{p \in U} T_p^\vee
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is very strange: <m>T_p^\vee</m> is the set of linear
      functions on each tangent space <m>T_p</m>. Therefore, a 1-form
      is a function that, at each point of the manifold, outputs a new
      linear function on its own tangent space <m>T_p</m>. Functions
      that output other functions <mdash/> it's a valid definition,
      but difficult to parse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the <m>\del_i</m> are a basis for each <m>T_p</m> and
      differential forms create linear function on the <m>T_p</m>, it
      is sufficent to know their effect on the <m>\del_i</m>. We can
      make use of the dual basis defined above.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>du_i</m> to be the unique differential form that acts
          on each <m>\del_i</m> by 
          <me>
            du_i (\del_i) = \delta_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1
            \amp i = j \\ 0 \amp i \neq j \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The <m>du_i</m> for the dual basis to <m>\del_i</m>. A general
      1-form <m>\omega</m> can always be written in terms of this
      basis. If the <m>f_i</m> are scalar functions, then all 1-forms
      are written as a linear combination of the <m>du_i</m>.
      <me>
        \omega = \sum_{i=1}^k f_i du_i
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This defines 1-forms in a much more tangible way. Since 1-forms
      output linear functions on the tangent space <m>T_p</m>, we
      think of them acting on tangent vectors. Informally, higher
      degree forms are defined similarly; the only difference is that
      they act on <m>m</m>-tuples of vectors. A 1-form acts on one
      vector, but an <m>m</m>-forms acts on a <m>m</m> vectors.
      Instead of giving a precise definition for this action, we'll
      define higher order forms out of 1-form by the operations in the
      next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We still have a bit of a problem. This description, including
      the definition of the basis <m>du_i</m>, all happened on a chart
      <m>U</m>, not the whole manifold. To finish the definition, we
      need to use the whole atlas of charts.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential form on a manifold <m>M</m> is given by a
          differential form for each <m>U_i</m> in on an atlas of
          charts such that the definition agree on the overlaps <m>U_i
          \cap U_j</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So, now, how do differential 1-forms agree? Let's do the same
      analysis we did before for a vector field. We'll use the same
      two-dimensional setup. Let <m>\phi_1(u,v)</m> and
      <m>\phi_2(s,t)</m> be coordinate function and <m>D = D_1 \cap
      D_2</m> the portion of the manifold where they overlap. A
      differential 1-form on <m>D</m> can first be describe in the
      original coordinates <m>u,v</m>.
      <me>
        f_1((u,v)) du + f_2((u,v)) dv
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we change this into a description in the new variables
      <m>s,t</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we have the transition function <m>T = \phi_1^{-1} \circ
      \phi_2</m> which starts with <m>(s,t)</m> and outputs
      <m>(u,v)</m>. Like a vector field, we can replace <m>(u,v)</m>
      with <m>T(s,t)</m>.
      <me>
        f_1(T(s,t))) du + f_2(T(s,t))) dv
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like vector fields, this is again only halfway. How do the
      <m>du</m> and <m>dv</m> change? We look to the chain rule again
      for inspiration. If <m>du</m> and <m>dv</m> were derivative
      (and not differential forms), the chain rule calculation would
      look like this.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          du \amp = \frac{\del u}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del u}{\del t}
          dt
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          dv \amp = \frac{\del v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t}
          dt
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we can write this as a matrix transformation.
      <me>
        \left( du \ dv \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \dfrac{\del
        u}{\del s} \amp \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \\[1em] \dfrac{\del
        u}{\del t} \amp \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} \end{matrix} \right)
        \left( \begin{matrix} ds \\[1em] dt \end{matrix} \right) =
        J(T) \left( \begin{matrix} ds \\[1em] dt \end{matrix} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We finish the transformation of the differential form.
      <me>
        f_1((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del u}{\del s} du + \frac{\del
        u}{\del t} dv \right] + f_2((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del
        v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t} dt \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we used the chain rule as if these differential form were
      derivatives, which they are not  What is the justification that
      this chain rule works? Well, differential forms act on vector
      fields as a dual basis. That means the following four equations
      should hold.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          ds(\del_s) \amp = 1 \hspace{2cm} ds(\del_t) = 0
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          dt(\del_s) \amp = 0 \hspace{2cm} dt(\del_t) = 1
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's check that our new forms for <m>ds</m> and <m>dt</m>,
      acting on the transformed form for <m>\del_s</m> and
      <m>\del_t</m>, actually satisfy this equation. If they do, then
      we are justified in using our chain-rule calculations. We start
      with the first of the four equations.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          ds(\del_s) \amp = \left( \frac{\del u}{\del s} du +
          \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \right) \left( \frac{\del s}{\del
          u} \del_u + \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right)
        </mrow>
        <intertext>The action is linear, to we break this into two terms.</intertext>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \frac{\del u}{\del s} du \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u}
          \del_u + \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right) \ + \frac{\del
          u}{\del t} dv \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u +
          \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right)
        </mrow>
        <intertext>Again, the action is linear, to we distribute it.</intertext>

          \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u \right) + \frac{\del

        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{\del s}{\del u}
          du(\del_u) + \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{\del s}{\del v}
          du(\del_v) + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{\del s}{\del u}
          dv(\del_u) + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{\del s}{\del v}

      The first of the four equation is satisfied. The remainin three
      are very similar calculations. This justifies the expressions
      we used for <m>ds</m> and <m>dt</m>: after changing to <m>du</m>
      and <m>dv</m>, we produce the require and expected action onf
      <m>\del_u</m> and <m>\del_v</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice, unlike the case for vector fields, that the composition
      is with <m>T</m> and we use the Jacobian matrix of <m>T</m> as
      well. Objects on manifold that transform this way, where the
      same transition function is used for composition and for the
      Jacobian, are called <em>covariant</em>. This is a very
      important distinction between vector fields and differential
      forms: vector fields are contravariant and differential forms
      are covariant. We will make use of this when we define
      integration.

    <title>Products and Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      There are four important operations that we can perform on
      differential forms. First, differential forms are linear, so we
      can add, subtract and multiply by constants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, there is a product of forms which is called the exterior
      product. We'll define it on 1-forms, but it can be extended to
      any degree. In general, the exterior product adds the degrees
      of the forms; in particular, the product of two 1-forms will be
      a 2-form.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> and <m>\eta</m> be 1-forms. They each act
          on vectors in tangent spaces. Their <term>exterior
          product</term> is a 2-form, so it acts on two vectors from
          each tangent space. It is defined by the following
          formula.
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta (v_1,v_2) = \omega(v_1) \eta(v_2) -
            \omega(v_2) \eta(v_1)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The exterior product is associative. if <m>\omega</m>,
          <m>\eta</m> and <m>\sigma</m> are all forms, then
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta \wedge \sigma = \omega \wedge (\eta
            \wedge \sigma) = (\omega \wedge \eta) \wedge \sigma
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The exterior product is not commutative. Instead, it is
          anti-communtative.
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta = - \eta \wedge \omega
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The anti-commutativity is easy to see from the definition. It
      implies a strange but very important property of the exterior
      product.
      <me>
        \omega \wedge \omega = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the basis <m>du_i</m>, we had a description of any 1-form
      as a linear combination of the <m>du_i</m> (where the scalars
      were scalar functions). The exterior product gives a basis for
      higher degree forms. However, anti-commutativity implies that
      <m>du_i \wedge du_i = 0</m>, so the basis for the 2-forms are
      all <m>du_i \wedge du_j</m> such that <m>i \neq j</m>.
      Likewise, the 3-forms have a basis <m>du_i \wedge du_j \wedge
      du_k</m> where all three indices are distinct. In general,
      <m>l</m>-forms are spanned by wedges of <m>du_i</m> of length
      <m>l</m> where no index is repeated. When any index is
      repeated, the form becomes 0. After we have these bases, any
      form is a linear combination of the basis elements, where the
      coefficients are scalar functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to a product, there is a derivative for differential
      forms.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> be a 1-form, which we write with the basis
          <m>du_i</m>.
          <me>
            \omega = \sum_{i=1}^k f_i du_i
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The the <term>exterior derivative</term> of <m>\omega</m> is
          written <m>d\omega</m> and is expressed as follows.
          <me>
            dw = \sum_{i=1}^k \left( \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^k \frac{\del
            f_i}{\del x_j} du_j \wedge du_i \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For higher degree forms, a similar equation holds: we
          express the form in a basis of wedges of <m>du_i</m> and
          differentiate the coefficient scalar functions. Each time
          we differentiate <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i}</m> we add a
          <m>du_i \wedge</m> to the start of the wedge product.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter, we talked about how certain
      differential operators composed to zero: the curl of a gradient
      is zero and the divergence of a curl is zero. The exterior
      derivative lives up to this legacy perfectly.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\omega</m> is any differential form, then
          <m>d(d\omega) = 0</m>. Succinctly, we write <m>d^2 = 0</m>
          for the exterior derivative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The is nothing radical or insightful about the proof. We just
        apply the expression for the exterior derivative twice and do
        a lot of tedious algebra with the indicies. All the terms
        cancel out and we get zero.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      There is one last operator on forms.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> be a k-form and <m>v</m> is a vector field
          on the manifold. The <term>interior product</term> of
          <m>\omega</m> and <m>v</m> is written <m>i_v \omega</m>. It
          is a k-1-form and is defined as follows.
          <me>
            i_v \omega (v_1, \ldots, v_{k-1}) = \omega(v,v_1, \ldots,
            v_{k-1})
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As a differential k-form, <m>\omega</m> acts on <m>k</m>
      vectors. The interior product simply insist that the first
      vector acted on is always the vector <m>v</m>, leaving the
      remainin <m>k-1</m> vectors undetermined.

    <title>Differential Forms in <m>\RR^3</m></title>
    <p>
      The definitions so far have all been very abstract, so lets try
      to specialize back to <m>\RR^3</m> to see what happens. In this
      section, our manifold will simple be an open set <m>U</m> in
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Its coordinate function is simply the identity

      coordinates <m>x,y,z</m> as local coordinates on <m>U</m> and
      define fields and forms interms of these local coordinates.
      (Here, the local and ambient coordinate are the same.)

      It is impossible to have a differential form of degree 4 or
      higher, since a 4-form must have at least one repeated
      <m>dx</m>, <m>dy</m> or <m>dz</m> term and forms with repeated
      basis terms are zero. The degree of forms is bounded by the
      dimension of the object. For the 2-forms, the ordering of the
      basis is related to orientation. We will stick with the order
      as presented above.

      If <m>\omega_0</m>, <m>\omega_1</m>, <m>\omega_2</m> and
      <m>\omega_3</m> are 0, 1, 2, and 3 forms respectively, they are
      written in terms of the basis by using scalar fields <m>f_i</m>
      as follows.

      Now we can consider the exterior derivatives of these forms.
      This will start to show us the connection to the vector
      calculus.
    </p>

      First, let's differentiate <m>\omega_0</m>, which just a scalar
      field. Its derivative, however, will be a 1-form.
      <me>
        d \omega_0 = \frac{\del f}{\del x} dx + \frac{\del f}{\del y}
        dy + \frac{\del f}{\del z} dz = df = \nabla f \cdot (dx, dy,
        dz)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a 0-form (scalar field) recovers the
      gradient operator. The gradient is the <em>coefficients</em> of
      the 1-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's take <m>\omega_1</m> a 1-form and calculate its
      exterior derivative. This derivative will be a 2-form.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \omega_1 \amp = f_1 dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz

          \frac{\del f_3}{\del x} \right) dz \wedge dx + \left(
          \frac{\del f_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del f_1}{\del y} \right) dx
          \wedge dy

        <mrow>
          \amp = \left( \nabla \times (f_1, f_2, f_3) \right) \cdot

      If we do the orientation correctly and choose the basis order as
      we did, we recover the curl operation. Again, the curl gives
      the <em>coefficients</em> of this 2-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a 0-form involed the gradient. For a
      1-form, it involved the curl. If we take a 0-form
      <m>\omega_0</m> and take the exterior derivative twice, then the
      fact <m>d (d\omega_0) = 0</m> is equivalent to the identity
      <m>\nabla \times \nabla f = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's take <m>\omega_2</m> a 2-form and calculate its
      exterior derivative.

          \frac{\del f_3}{\del z} dz \wedge dx \wedge dy
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \left( \frac{\del f_1}{\del x} + \frac{\del f_2}{\del
          y} + \frac{\del f_3}{\del z} \right) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \left( \nabla \cdot (f_1, f_2, f_3) \right) dx \wedge

    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a 2-form recovers the divergence
      operator. Again, <m>d^2 = 0</m> on a 1-form recovers the
      identity that <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times F) = 0</m> from
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three operators: gradient, divergence and curl, are found in
      the exterior derivative in the right degree. Our vector fields
      defined previously were never really vectors fields!  They can
      now be interpreted as the component functions of either 1-forms
      or 2-forms in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of potentials also generalize. On a simply connected
      open set, we can prove that <m>d\omega_1 = 0 \implies \omega =
      df</m>, i.e, we can find scalar potentials. Similarly,
      <m>d\omega_2 = 0 \implies \omega_2 = d \omega_1</m>, i.e., we
      can find vector potentials. This is part of a very general
      theorem that any differential form on a simply connected open
      set which satisfies <m>d \omega = 0</m> must have another form
      as its potential, i.e., <m>\omega = d \eta</m>. There is some
      language for this situation.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential form <m>\omega</m> is called
          <term>closed</term> if <m>d \omega = 0</m>. It is called
          exact is there exists another form <m>\eta</m> with
          <m>\omega = d\eta</m>. On a simply connected open set, all
          closed forms are exact. On an arbitrary set, there are
          often closed forms which are not exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      These results about finding potentials are local on manifolds,
      where we can also work with these simply connected open sets.
      Whether we can find a potential that works everywhere is a major
      question in differential geometry. The problems that prevent us
      from finding such global potentials are called
      <em>obstructions</em> and obstructions are the building blocks
      of structures called (co)homology theories. A great deal of
      effort is spent studying (co)homology theories on manifolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the great advantages of working with differential forms
      is that all the algebra works in any dimension. This tells us
      how to generalize definition which were previously specific to
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Curl is particular to <m>\RR^3</m>, and it is not
      at all obvious what the generlization of curl is in higher
      dimensions. Now that curl is the just the exterior derivative
      of differential 2-form, the extension of curl is the same: the
      exterior derivative of a 2-form in any higher dimension. The
      exterior derivative will give the formula in terms of
      components. The question of potentials is also now extendable,
      since asking for potentials is the same as asking when a k-form
      <m>\omega_k</m> which satisifes <m>d\omega_k = 0</m> also has
      <m>\omega_k = d \omega_{k-1}</m> for <m>\omega_{k-1}</m> some
      k-1-form.
