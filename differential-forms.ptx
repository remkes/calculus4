  <title>Differential Forms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now we can start to define the main object of this chapter:
      the differential form.
      The definition is quite odd: be warned.
      However, we will be rewarded by the end of the chapter.
      We start with a little bit of linear algebra.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be a vector space over <m>\RR</m>.
          The <term>dual space</term> of <m>L</m> is the space of all linear functions <m>f: L \rightarrow \RR</m>.
          It is a linear space of the same dimension as <m>L</m> and is written <m>L^\vee</m>.
          If <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m>,
          then the <term>dual basis</term> for <m>L^\vee</m> is the set of functions <m>f_i</m> such that <m>f_i(v_j) = \delta_{ij}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Differential forms are classified by their degree,
      which is a non-negative integer.
      Instead of attempting a full definition,
      we will start with the lowest degree forms and work our way up,
      using some of this linear algebra language.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A degree <m>0</m> differential form (0-form) on a manifold <m>M</m> is just a scalar field on <m>M</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a manifold of dimension <m>k</m> and
          <m>\phi: D \rightarrow U</m> a coordinate functionon <m>M</m>.
          A degree <m>1</m> differential form (1-form) on the chart <m>U</m> is a function <m>\omega</m> defined on <m>U</m> as follows.
          <me>
            \omega: U \rightarrow \bigcup_{p \in U} T_p^\vee
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is very strange:
      <m>T_p^\vee</m> is the set of linear functions on each tangent space <m>T_p</m>.
      Therefore, a 1-form is a function that,
      at each point of the manifold,
      outputs a new linear function on its own tangent space <m>T_p</m>.
      Functions that output other functions <mdash/> it's a valid definition,
      but difficult to parse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the <m>\del_i</m> are a basis for each <m>T_p</m> and differential forms create linear function on the <m>T_p</m>,
      it is sufficent to know their effect on the <m>\del_i</m>.
      We can make use of the dual basis defined above.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>du_i</m> to be the unique differential form that acts on each <m>\del_i</m> by
          <me>
            du_i (\del_i) = \delta_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 \amp  i = j \\ 0 \amp  i \neq j \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The <m>du_i</m> for the dual basis to <m>\del_i</m>.
      A general 1-form <m>\omega</m> can always be written in terms of this basis.
      If the <m>f_i</m> are scalar functions,
      then all 1-forms are written as a linear combination of the <m>du_i</m>.
      <me>
        \omega = \sum_{i=1}^k f_i du_i
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This defines 1-forms in a much more tangible way.
      Since 1-forms output linear functions on the tangent space <m>T_p</m>,
      we think of them acting on tangent vectors.
      Informally, higher degree forms are defined similarly;
      the only difference is that they act on <m>m</m>-tuples of vectors.
      A 1-form acts on one vector, but an <m>m</m>-forms acts on a <m>m</m> vectors.
      Instead of giving a precise definition for this action,
      we'll define higher order forms out of 1-form by the operations in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We still have a bit of a problem.
      This description, including the definition of the basis <m>du_i</m>,
      all happened on a chart <m>U</m>, not the whole manifold.
      To finish the definition, we need to use the whole atlas of charts.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential form on a manifold <m>M</m> is given by a differential form for each <m>U_i</m> in on an atlas of charts such that the definition agree on the overlaps <m>U_i \cap U_j</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So, now, how do differential 1-forms agree?
      Let's do the same analysis we did before for a vector field.
      We'll use the same two-dimensional setup.
      Let <m>\phi_1(u,v)</m> and
      <m>\phi_2(s,t)</m> be coordinate function and
      <m>D = D_1 \cap D_2</m> the portion of the manifold where they overlap.
      A differential 1-form on <m>D</m> can first be describe in the original coordinates <m>u,v</m>.
      <me>
        f_1((u,v)) du + f_2((u,v)) dv
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we change this into a description in the new variables <m>s,t</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we have the transition function
      <m>T = \phi_1^{-1} \circ \phi_2</m> which starts with <m>(s,t)</m> and outputs <m>(u,v)</m>.
      Like a vector field, we can replace <m>(u,v)</m> with <m>T(s,t)</m>.
      <me>
        f_1(T(s,t))) du + f_2(T(s,t))) dv
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like vector fields, this is again only halfway.
      How do the <m>du</m> and <m>dv</m> change?
      We look to the chain rule again for inspiration.
      If <m>du</m> and <m>dv</m> were derivative
      (and not differential forms),
      the chain rule calculation would look like this.
      <md>
        <mrow>du \amp  = \frac{\del u}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dt</mrow>
        <mrow>dv \amp  = \frac{\del v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t} dt</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we can write this as a matrix transformation.
      <me>
        \left( du \ dv \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \amp \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \\[1em] \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \amp \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{matrix} ds \\[1em] dt \end{matrix} \right) = J(T) \left( \begin{matrix} ds \\[1em] dt \end{matrix} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We finish the transformation of the differential form.
      <me>
        f_1((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del u}{\del s} du + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \right] + f_2((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t} dt \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we used the chain rule as if these differential form were derivatives,
      which they are not.
      What is the justification that this chain rule works?
      Well, differential forms act on vector fields as a dual basis.
      That means the following four equations should hold.
      <md>
        <mrow>ds(\del_s) \amp  = 1 \hspace{2cm} ds(\del_t) = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>dt(\del_s) \amp  = 0 \hspace{2cm} dt(\del_t) = 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's check that our new forms for <m>ds</m> and <m>dt</m>,
      acting on the transformed form for <m>\del_s</m> and <m>\del_t</m>,
      actually satisfy this equation.
      If they do, then we are justified in using our chain-rule calculations.
      We start with the first of the four equations.
      <md>
        <mrow>ds(\del_s) \amp  = \left( \frac{\del u}{\del s} du + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \right) \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u + \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right)</mrow>
        <intertext>The action is linear, to we break this into two terms.</intertext>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\del u}{\del s} du \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u + \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right) \ + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u + \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right)</mrow>
        <intertext>Again, the action is linear, to we distribute it.</intertext>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\del u}{\del s} du \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u \right) + \frac{\del u}{\del s} du \left( \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right) \ + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \left( \frac{\del s}{\del u} \del_u \right) + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \left( \frac{\del s}{\del v} \del_v \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{\del s}{\del u} du(\del_u) + \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{\del s}{\del v} du(\del_v) + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{\del s}{\del u} dv(\del_u) + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{\del s}{\del v} dv(\del_v)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{\del s}{\del u} + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{\del s}{\del v} \right)</mrow>
        <intertext>Now we use the expressions we derived in the previous section to replace <m>\frac{\del s}{\del u}</m> and <m>\frac{\del s}{\del v}</m>.</intertext>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \frac{\del u}{\del s} \frac{1}{ \left( \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} - \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right) } \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \frac{-1}{ \left( \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} - \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right) } \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \frac{1}{ \left( \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} - \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right) } \right) \left( \frac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} + \frac{\del u}{\del t} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\left( \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} - \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right)}{\left( \dfrac{\del u}{\del s} \dfrac{\del v}{\del t} - \dfrac{\del v}{\del s} \dfrac{\del u}{\del t} \right)} = 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the four equation is satisfied.
      The remainin three are very similar calculations.
      This justifies the expressions we used for <m>ds</m> and <m>dt</m>:
      after changing to <m>du</m> and <m>dv</m>,
      we produce the require and expected action onf <m>\del_u</m> and <m>\del_v</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice, unlike the case for vector fields,
      that the composition is with <m>T</m> and we use the Jacobian matrix of <m>T</m> as well.
      Objects on manifold that transform this way,
      where the same transition function is used for composition and for the Jacobian,
      are called <em>covariant</em>.
      This is a very important distinction between vector fields and differential forms:
      vector fields are contravariant and differential forms are covariant.
      We will make use of this when we define integration.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="products-derivatives">
    <title>Products and Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      There are four important operations that we can perform on differential forms.
      First, differential forms are linear, so we can add,
      subtract and multiply by constants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, there is a product of forms which is called the exterior product.
      We'll define it on 1-forms, but it can be extended to any degree.
      In general, the exterior product adds the degrees of the forms;
      in particular, the product of two 1-forms will be a 2-form.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> and <m>\eta</m> be 1-forms.
          They each act on vectors in tangent spaces.
          Their <term>exterior product</term> is a 2-form,
          so it acts on two vectors from each tangent space.
          It is defined by the following formula.
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta (v_1,v_2) = \omega(v_1) \eta(v_2) - \omega(v_2) \eta(v_1)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The exterior product is associative. if <m>\omega</m>,
          <m>\eta</m> and <m>\sigma</m> are all forms, then
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta \wedge \sigma = \omega \wedge (\eta \wedge \sigma) = (\omega \wedge \eta) \wedge \sigma
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The exterior product is not commutative.
          Instead, it is anti-communtative.
          <me>
            \omega \wedge \eta = - \eta \wedge \omega
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The anti-commutativity is easy to see from the definition.
      It implies a strange but very important property of the exterior product.
      <me>
        \omega \wedge \omega = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the basis <m>du_i</m>,
      we had a description of any 1-form as a linear combination of the <m>du_i</m>
      (where the scalars were scalar functions).
      The exterior product gives a basis for higher degree forms.
      However, anti-commutativity implies that <m>du_i \wedge du_i = 0</m>,
      so the basis for the 2-forms are all
      <m>du_i \wedge du_j</m> such that <m>i \neq j</m>.
      Likewise, the 3-forms have a basis
      <m>du_i \wedge du_j \wedge du_k</m> where all three indices are distinct.
      In general, <m>l</m>-forms are spanned by wedges of <m>du_i</m> of length <m>l</m> where no index is repeated.
      When any index is repeated, the form becomes 0.
      After we have these bases,
      any form is a linear combination of the basis elements,
      where the coefficients are scalar functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to a product, there is a derivative for differential forms.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> be a 1-form,
          which we write with the basis <m>du_i</m>.
          <me>
            \omega = \sum_{i=1}^k f_i du_i
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The the <term>exterior derivative</term>
          of <m>\omega</m> is written <m>d\omega</m> and is expressed as follows.
          <me>
            dw = \sum_{i=1}^k \left( \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^k \frac{\del f_i}{\del x_j} du_j \wedge du_i \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For higher degree forms, a similar equation holds:
          we express the form in a basis of wedges of <m>du_i</m> and differentiate the coefficient scalar functions.
          Each time we differentiate <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i}</m> we add a
          <m>du_i \wedge</m> to the start of the wedge product.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter,
      we talked about how certain differential operators composed to zero:
      the curl of a gradient is zero and the divergence of a curl is zero.
      The exterior derivative lives up to this legacy perfectly.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\omega</m> is any differential form,
          then <m>d(d\omega) = 0</m>.
          Succinctly, we write <m>d^2 = 0</m> for the exterior derivative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The is nothing radical or insightful about the proof.
        We just apply the expression for the exterior derivative twice and do a lot of tedious algebra with the indicies.
        All the terms cancel out and we get zero.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      There is one last operator on forms.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\omega</m> be a k-form and <m>v</m> is a vector field on the manifold.
          The <term>interior product</term>
          of <m>\omega</m> and <m>v</m> is written <m>i_v \omega</m>.
          It is a k-1-form and is defined as follows.
          <me>
            i_v \omega (v_1, \ldots, v_{k-1}) = \omega(v,v_1, \ldots, v_{k-1})
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As a differential k-form, <m>\omega</m> acts on <m>k</m> vectors.
      The interior product simply insist that the first vector acted on is always the vector <m>v</m>,
      leaving the remainin <m>k-1</m> vectors undetermined.

  <subsection xml:id="differential-forms-r3">
    <title>Differential Forms in <m>\RR^3</m></title>
    <p>
      The definitions so far have all been very abstract,
      so lets try to specialize back to <m>\RR^3</m> to see what happens.
      In this section,
      our manifold will simple be an open set <m>U</m> in <m>\RR^3</m>.
      Its coordinate function is simply the identity <m>\Id: U \rightarrow U</m>.
      This lets us use the familiar coordinates <m>x,y,z</m> as local coordinates on <m>U</m> and define fields and forms interms of these local coordinates.
      (Here, the local and ambient coordinate are the same.)
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ Vector Fields }  \amp  \del_x,\ \del_y,\ \del_z</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ 1-Forms }  \amp  dx,\ dy,\ dz</mrow>

        <mrow>\text{ 3-Forms }  \amp  dx \wedge dy \wedge dz</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to have a differential form of degree 4 or higher,
      since a 4-form must have at least one repeated <m>dx</m>,
      <m>dy</m> or <m>dz</m> term and forms with repeated basis terms are zero.
      The degree of forms is bounded by the dimension of the object.
      For the 2-forms,
      the ordering of the basis is related to orientation.
      We will stick with the order as presented above.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>\omega_0</m>, <m>\omega_1</m>,
      <m>\omega_2</m> and <m>\omega_3</m> are 0, 1, 2, and 3 forms respectively,
      they are written in terms of the basis by using scalar fields <m>f_i</m> as follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>\omega_0 \amp  = f</mrow>
        <mrow>\omega_1 \amp  = f_1 dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz</mrow>
        <mrow>\omega_2 \amp  = f_1 dy\wedge dz + f_2 dz\wedge dx + f_3 dx \wedge dy</mrow>
        <mrow>\omega_3 \amp  = f dx \wedge dy \wedge dz</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can consider the exterior derivatives of these forms.
      This will start to show us the connection to the vector calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, let's differentiate <m>\omega_0</m>,
      which just a scalar field.
      Its derivative, however, will be a 1-form.
      <me>
        d \omega_0 = \frac{\del f}{\del x} dx + \frac{\del f}{\del y} dy + \frac{\del f}{\del z} dz = df = \nabla f \cdot (dx, dy, dz)
      </me>

      The exterior derivative of a 0-form
      (scalar field)
      recovers the gradient operator.
      The gradient is the <em>coefficients</em> of the 1-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's take <m>\omega_1</m> a 1-form and calculate its exterior derivative.
      This derivative will be a 2-form.
      <md>
        <mrow>\omega_1 \amp  = f_1 dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz</mrow>
        <mrow>d \omega_1 \amp  = \frac{\del f_1}{\del y} dy \wedge dx + \frac{\del f_1}{\del z} dz \wedge dx + \frac{\del f_2}{\del x} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\del f_2}{\del z} dz \wedge dy + \frac{\del f_3}{\del x} dx \wedge dz + \frac{\del f_3}{\del y} dy \wedge dz</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = - \frac{\del f_1}{\del y} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\del f_1}{\del z} dz \wedge dx + \frac{\del f_2}{\del x} dx \wedge dy - \frac{\del f_2}{\del z} dy \wedge dz - \frac{\del f_3}{\del x} dz \wedge dx + \frac{\del f_3}{\del y} dy \wedge dz</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \frac{\del f_3}{\del y} - \frac{\del f_2}{\del z} \right) dy \wedge dz + \left( \frac{\del f_1}{\del z} - \frac{\del f_3}{\del x} \right) dz \wedge dx + \left( \frac{\del f_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del f_1}{\del y} \right) dx \wedge dy</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \nabla \times (f_1, f_2, f_3) \right) \cdot (dy \wedge dz, dz \wedge dx, dx \wedge dy)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do the orientation correctly and choose the basis order as we did,
      we recover the curl operation.
      Again, the curl gives the <em>coefficients</em> of this 2-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a 0-form involed the gradient.
      For a 1-form, it involved the curl.
      If we take a 0-form <m>\omega_0</m> and take the exterior derivative twice,
      then the fact <m>d (d\omega_0) = 0</m> is equivalent to the identity <m>\nabla \times \nabla f = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's take <m>\omega_2</m> a 2-form and calculate its exterior derivative.
      <md>
        <mrow>\omega_2 \amp  = f_1 dy\wedge dz + f_2 dz\wedge dx + f_3 dx \wedge dy</mrow>
        <mrow>d \omega_2 \amp  = \frac{\del f_1}{\del x} dx \wedge dy \wedge dz + \frac{\del f_2}{\del y} dy \wedge dz \wedge dx + \frac{\del f_3}{\del z} dz \wedge dx \wedge dy</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \frac{\del f_1}{\del x} + \frac{\del f_2}{\del y} + \frac{\del f_3}{\del z} \right) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left( \nabla \cdot (f_1, f_2, f_3) \right) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a 2-form recovers the divergence operator.
      Again, <m>d^2 = 0</m> on a 1-form recovers the identity that <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times F) = 0</m> from before.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three operators: gradient, divergence and curl,
      are found in the exterior derivative in the right degree.
      Our vector fields defined previously were never really vectors fields!
      They can now be interpreted as the component functions of either 1-forms or 2-forms in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of potentials also generalize.
      On a simply connected open set,
      we can prove that <m>d\omega_1 = 0 \implies \omega = df</m>,
      i.e, we can find scalar potentials.
      Similarly, <m>d\omega_2 = 0 \implies \omega_2 = d \omega_1</m>,
      i.e., we can find vector potentials.
      This is part of a very general theorem that any differential form on a simply connected open set which satisfies
      <m>d \omega = 0</m> must have another form as its potential,
      i.e., <m>\omega = d \eta</m>.
      There is some language for this situation.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential form <m>\omega</m> is called
          <term>closed</term> if <m>d \omega = 0</m>.
          It is called exact is there exists another form <m>\eta</m> with <m>\omega = d\eta</m>.
          On a simply connected open set,
          all closed forms are exact.
          On an arbitrary set, there are often closed forms which are not exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      These results about finding potentials are local on manifolds,
      where we can also work with these simply connected open sets.
      Whether we can find a potential that works everywhere is a major question in differential geometry.
      The problems that prevent us from finding such global potentials are called <em>obstructions</em>
      and obstructions are the building blocks of structures called (co)homology theories.
      A great deal of effort is spent studying (co)homology theories on manifolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the great advantages of working with differential forms is that all the algebra works in any dimension.
      This tells us how to generalize definition which were previously specific to <m>\RR^3</m>.
      Curl is particular to <m>\RR^3</m>,
      and it is not at all obvious what the generlization of curl is in higher dimensions.
      Now that curl is the just the exterior derivative of differential 2-form,
      the extension of curl is the same:
      the exterior derivative of a 2-form in any higher dimension.
      The exterior derivative will give the formula in terms of components.
      The question of potentials is also now extendable,
      since asking for potentials is the same as asking when a k-form
      <m>\omega_k</m> which satisifes <m>d\omega_k = 0</m> also has
      <m>\omega_k = d \omega_{k-1}</m> for <m>\omega_{k-1}</m> some k-1-form.
