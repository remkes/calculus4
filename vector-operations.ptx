  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall the gradient <m>\nabla f</m> of a scalar field <m>f</m>.
      It's useful to recall the definition of the operator
      <m>\nabla</m>. (stated in <m>\RR^3</m> for convenience).
      <me>
        \nabla = \left( \frac{\del}{\del x}, \frac{\del}{\del y},
        \frac{\del}{\del z} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f</m> is a scalar field, then the gradient <m>\nabla f</m>
      is a <em>vector field</em> describing the direction of greatest
      change. We didn't investigate it's propreties as a vector field
      in Calculus III, but it was the first vector field we used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are new operators we can define using <m>\nabla</m> on
      vector fields <m>F</m>. <m>\nabla</m> operates a vector, since
      is has components which are differential operators. Therefore,
      we use vector notation involving <m>\nabla</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F : \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a vector field.
          The <term>curl</term> of <m>F</m> is defined as the the
          cross product of <m>\nabla</m> and <m>F</m>. Note that this
          outputs a new vector field, not a scalar field.
          <me>
            \nabla \times F = \left( \frac{\del F_3}{\del y} -
            \frac{\del F_2}{\del z}, \frac{\del F_1}{\del z} -
            \frac{\del F_3}{\del x}, \frac{\del F_2}{\del x} -
            \frac{\del F_1}{\del y}, \right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Curl measures the tendency of the vector field to cause
      <em>local</em> rotation. If we think of the vector field as a
      fluid flow and if we drop an object in the fluid, it will flow
      along the integral curves of the vector field. However, as it
      flows along, it may also start spinning about its own axis.
      Curl measure the tendency of the vector field to cause such a
      spin. (This is very different from global rotation. The paths
      of rotation themselves may be circular without actually causing
      the object itself to spin. Likewise, the paths can be totally
      straight but still cause rotation.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector field with zero curl is called
          <term>irrotational</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>F(x,y,z) = (y,0,0)</m>. This is a field which
          moves objects in the <m>x</m> direction, but the speed of
          movement varies with the <m>y</m> coordinate. The curl is
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,-1)</m>. This field causes a
          clockwise rotation about the <m>z</m> axis; as particles in
          the fluid move in the <m>x</m> direction, they start
          spinning around a vertical axis.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a vector field in
          any dimension. The <term>divergence</term> of <m>F</m> is
          the dot product <m>\nabla \cdot F</m>. Note that this
          outputs a new scalar field, not a vector field.
          <me>
            \nabla \cdot F = \frac{\del F_1}{\del x_1} + \frac{\del
            F_2}{\del x_2} + \ldots + \frac{\del F_n}{\del x_n}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The divergence measure the tendency of a vector field to
      diffuse. Thinking in terms of gaseous fluids, a positive
      divergence at a point means that the density of the gas is
      <em>decreasing</em>. Some directions of flow may be inward and
      some outward, but there is a net diffusion of the gas. If the
      divergence is negative, the density is <em>increasing</em> and
      there is a net gathering of the gas.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector where where the divergence is zero is called
          <term>incompressible</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Many liquids are incompressible, at least locally and under
      reasonable energy circumstances. Water is usually treated as an
      incompressible fluid. The major difference in fluid dynamics
      between gases and liquid is compressibility.
    </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be is a scalar field <m>\RR^n \rightarrow
          \RR</m>. It's <term>Laplacian</term> is the divergence of
          its gradient: <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \nabla^2 f</m>.
          Note that this outputs a scalar field.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The Laplacian was mentioned in the previous term, since the
      input and output are both scalar fields. However, the
      intermediate state (the gradient) is a vector field, and the
      second part of the operation (the divergence) is a vector
      operation. This persepctive of the Laplacian is quite useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Laplacian is very important for many differential equations
      in physics. As the divergence of the gradient field, it
      measures where the scalar field leads to a gathering or
      spreading. In a potential energy field, it measures the sources
      (attractors) and repellors which generate the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two important differential equations introduced in
      Calculus III: the heat equation and the wave equation.
      Extending these DES to several dimensions uses the Laplacian.
      Recall the 1-variable and multi-variable versions of those two
      equations.

      Replacing the 1-variable position derivative with a
      multivariable Laplacian extends these DEs to several variables.

    <p>
      We've also seen the Laplacian in the Schrodinger equation
      and the Navier-Stokes equation as the space derivative term.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wave equation, if <m>\nabla^2 f = 0</m> then
      <m>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} = 0</m>. Therefore, <m>f</m> has,
      at most, a linear dependence in <m>t</m>. Since the dependence
      in <m>x</m> is often sinusoidal, a common solution here is a
      standing wave or a wave with constant velocity. This (among
      other, more confusing reasons) leads to the terminology of
      harmonic functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A scalar field <m>f</m> is <term>harmonic</term> if
          <m>\nabla^2 f = 0</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The harmonic condition is a very restrictive condition. In
      particular, harmonic functions satify a maximum modulus
      principle: if <m>f</m> has an strict extrema in an open set,
      then it has a point with non-zero Laplacian and cannot be
      harmonic. Therefore, the extrema of <m>f</m> must always come
      on the boundary of any open set. In complex analysis, all
      differentiable (holomorphic) functions are harmonic; this fact
      leads to very different behaviour between real and complex
      differentiable functions.

      In the first Leibniz rule we have a difference instead of the
      expected sum. In general versions of the Leibniz rule, this
      negative sign is quite common. Many versions of the rule have
      <m>(-1)^k</m> for some <m>k</m>, showing that it is equally easy
      to have a sum or difference.

          a vector field on <m>\RR^3</m>. Then <m>\nabla \times
          (\nabla f) = 0</m>: the curl of a gradient is zero. Also,

      This proposition is established by calculating all the terms and
      using the compatibility of order in mixed second partial
      derivatives. The proofs are left as exercises.

    <p>
      This proposition is also a glimpse of a very general result in
      analysis. If we work with the right definitions, applying the
      same (or similar) differential operator twice in a row should
      give the zero operator. Obviously, this isn't always true:
      partial derivatives certainly don't satisfy this, and even for
      <m>\nabla</m>, <m>\nabla \cdot \nabla f \neq 0</m> for a general
      scalar field. Near the end of these notes, we will give a
      general structure for understanding why differential operators
      should compose to zero.

          This is a harmonic scalar field. In particular, it can have
          no extrema on an open set. Values approach <m>-\infty</m>
          near the origin and <m>\infty</m> as we get very far from
          the origin.

          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (-z,x,-y)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (-1,1,1)</m>, so the vector field
          causes the same local rotation at all points, about the axis
          <m>(-1,1,1)</m> (as a local axis direction). <m>\nabla
          \cdot F = (0,0,0)</m>, so the flow is incompressible. This
          is a good field to potentially model a liquid flow that
          induces a particular local rotation everywhere.

          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,0)</m>, so the field is
          irrotational. The divergence is <m>\nabla \cdot F = (2x
          +2y+2z)</m>. In the positive octant, the flow accelerates
          away from the origin, so the rate of difussion increases
          away from the origin In other octants, we may have negative
          divergence, reflecting the fact that the local vector field
          directions are always positive.

          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (-y,x,0)</m> (which
          should be fairly familiar by this time). <m>\nabla \times F
          = (0,0,2)</m>, which shows the creation of local rotation
          about the <m>z</m> axis. Note that this is local rotation,
          which is seperate from the global rotation of the integral
          curves about the origin. Also, <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>,
          so the flow is incompressible. As the flow spins around, it
          neither collects or diffuses anywhere.

          irrotational. This is interesting, given the trigonometric
          term; trigonometry might cause us to expect spin. <m>\nabla
          \cdot F = \cos x - \sin y</m>, so there are various areas of
          diffusion and collection. The trigonometric term here
          causes diffusion/collection, not rotation.
