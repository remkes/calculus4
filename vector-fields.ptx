  <title>Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    So far, we studies scalar fields <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>.
    When defining derivatives of various types,
    we only considered single-valued functions.
    In multiple integration,
    the integrands were functions with a single real output.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have mentioned functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> a few times,
    but only as transformations of spaces. . Those who have taken Linear Algebra are familiar with linear functions <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>,
    which are encoded in <m>m \times n</m> matrices.
    We used functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> as change of variables transformations for integrals.
    Their Jacobian matrices <m>J(F)</m> were square <m>n \times n</m> matrices,
    so we could take the determinant to define the Jacobian <m>|J(F)|</m>,
    which acted as a measure of the change in local size/area/volume for the purposes of integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interpreting functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as transformations of space is very useful and valuable.
    It connects well with linear algebra,
    where matrices are thought of as transformations.
    It serves multiple integration by allowing coordinate transformations.
    However, it is not the only conceptual way to understand such functions.
    We are now going to re-interpret these functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as vector fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of the work <sq>field</sq> here refers to a function on subsets of <m>\RR^n</m>.
    So far, we have worked with <em>scalar fields</em>,
    functions <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>.
    On <m>\RR^n</m>
    (or a subset),
    these functions output scalars.
    Conceptually,
    any scalar quantity that might differ throughout a three-dimensional region is a scalar fields.
    Familiar examples are temperature, pressure,
    concentration of some material in a solution, density,
    and elevation.
    Now we define the other type of field.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function on a region of <m>S \subset \RR^n</m> which outputs vectors is a
        <term>vector field</term>.
        If the output are <m>m</m>-vectors,
        we write <m>f: S \rightarrow \RR^m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Familiar examples are force,
    movement, acceleration, wind speed,
    ocean current speed, fluid flow,
    or the gradient of any differentiable scalar field.
    All these can vary over a region of space but need to be represented by a vector:
    by a magnitude and a direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector fields rely on the idea of local coordinates:
    the vector output is always a direction as if the current location is a local origin.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the constant vector field <m>F(x,y) = (0,1)</m> on <m>\RR^3</m>,
        as seen in <xref ref="figure-vector-field1">figure</xref>.
        The vector <m>(0,1)</m> is a unit vector in the vertical y-axis direction in <m>\RR^2</m>.
        This vector fields associates that unit vertical vector to each point in <m>\RR^2</m>
        (in local coordinates).
        At each point,
        the vector points vertically upward from that point.
        If this field represented a fluid flow,
        the fluid would be flowing upwards
        (in <m>y</m>)
        at a uniform pace everywhere,
        following these local direction vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is a vector field,
        then we can write <m>F = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n)</m> in terms of its <term>components</term>.
        Each component <m>F_i</m> is itself a scalar field,
        has partial derivatives and gradients,
        and is subject to all the tools we already have for scalar fields.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We can also use all the tools of vector analysis to understand vector fields.
    If <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is a vector field,
    then <m>|F|</m> is the length of each vector.
    <m>\frac{F}{|F|}</m> is the unit vector in each direction of <m>F</m> as long as <m>|F|</m> is not zero.
    If <m>G</m> is another vector field,
    then we can calculate the scalar field <m>F \cdot G</m> at each point.
    If <m>n=3</m>, we can also calculate <m>F \times G</m>.
    If <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is a scalar field,
    then the multiplication <m>fF</m> is a scalar multiplication of the vector <m>F</m> on each point in the domain of both functions.
    <m>F + G</m> and <m>F-G</m> are also vector fields,
    formed by adding or subtracting vectors.
    The expression <m>FG</m> doesn't make any sense,
    since we can't multiply vectors.

        An excellent example of a vectors field is the force of gravity,
        shown in <xref ref="figure-vector-field2">Figure</xref>.
        The magnitude of the force of gravity per unit mass due to a mass <m>M</m> at the origin is a scalar field.
        <m>(x,y,z)</m> is:
        <me>
          f = \frac{MG}{x^2+y^2+z^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the force itself also includes direction, so it is a vector field.
        <me>
          F = \frac{MG}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (-x,-y,-z)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The direction <m>(-x,-y,-z)</m> is back towards the origin.
        We can recover the magnitude by taking the length of the vector.
        <me>
          |F| = \frac{MG}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{x^2 +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{x^2 +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{r^2}
        </me>
