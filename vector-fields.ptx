  <title>Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    So far, we studies scalar fields <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>.
    When defining derivatives of various types, we only considered
    single-valued functions. In multiple integration, the integrands
    were functions with a single real output.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have mentioned functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> a
    few times, but only as transformations of spaces. . Those who have
    taken Linear Algebra are familiar with linear functions <m>\RR^n
    \rightarrow \RR^m</m>, which are encoded in <m>m \times n</m>
    matrices. We used functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> as
    change of variables transformations for integrals. Their Jacobian
    matrices <m>J(F)</m> were square <m>n \times n</m> matrices, so we
    could take the determinant to define the Jacobian <m>|J(F)|</m>,
    which acted as a measure of the change in local size/area/volume
    for the purposes of integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interpreting functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as
    transformations of space is very useful and valuable. It connects
    well with linear algebra, where matrices are thought of as
    transformations. It serves multiple integration by allowing
    coordinate transformations. However, it is not the only
    conceptual way to understand such functions. We are now going to
    re-interpret these functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as
    vector fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of the work <sq>field</sq> here refers to a function on
    subsets of <m>\RR^n</m>. So far, we have worked with <em>scalar
    fields</em>, functions <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>. On
    <m>\RR^n</m> (or a subset), these functions output scalars.
    Conceptually, any scalar quantity that might differ throughout a
    three-dimensional region is a scalar fields. Familiar examples
    are temperature, pressure, concentration of some material in a
    solution, density, and elevation. Now we define the other type of
    field.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function on a region of <m>S \subset \RR^n</m> which outputs
        vectors is a <term>vector field</term>. If the output are
        <m>m</m>-vectors, we write <m>f: S \rightarrow \RR^m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Familiar examples are force, movement, acceleration, wind speed,
    ocean current speed, fluid flow, or the gradient of any
    differentiable scalar field. All these can vary over a region of
    space but need to be represented by a vector: by a magnitude and a
    direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector fields rely on the idea of local coordinates: the vector
    output is always a direction as if the current location is a local
    origin.

        Consider the constant vector field <m>F(x,y) = (0,1)</m> on
        <m>\RR^3</m>, as seen in <xref ref="figure-vector-field1" />.
        The vector <m>(0,1)</m> is a unit vector in the vertical
        y-axis direction in <m>\RR^2</m>. This vector fields
        associates that unit vertical vector to each point in
        <m>\RR^2</m> (in local coordinates). At each point, the vector
        points vertically upward from that point. If this field
        represented a fluid flow, the fluid would be flowing upwards
        (in <m>y</m>) at a uniform pace everywhere, following these
        local direction vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is a vector field, then
        we can write <m>F = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n)</m> in terms of
        its <term>components</term>. Each component <m>F_i</m> is
        itself a scalar field, has partial derivatives and gradients,
        and is subject to all the tools we already have for scalar
        fields.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We can also use all the tools of vector analysis to understand
    vector fields. If <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is a vector
    field, then <m>|F|</m> is the length of each vector.
    <m>\frac{F}{|F|}</m> is the unit vector in each direction of
    <m>F</m> as long as <m>|F|</m> is not zero. If <m>G</m> is
    another vector field, then we can calculate the scalar field <m>F
    \cdot G</m> at each point. If <m>n=3</m>, we can also calculate
    <m>F \times G</m>. If <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is a scalar
    field, then the multiplication <m>fF</m> is a scalar
    multiplication of the vector <m>F</m> on each point in the domain
    of both functions. <m>F + G</m> and <m>F-G</m> are also vector
    fields, formed by adding or subtracting vectors. The expression
    <m>FG</m> doesn't make any sense, since we can't multiply
    vectors.

        An excellent example of a vectors field is the force of
        gravity, shown in <xref ref="figure-vector-field2" />. The
        magnitude of the force of gravity per unit mass due to a mass
        <m>M</m> at the origin is a scalar field. <m>(x,y,z)</m> is:
        <me>
          f = \frac{MG}{x^2+y^2+z^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the force itself also includes direction, so it is a
        vector field.
        <me>
          F = \frac{MG}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (-x,-y,-z)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The direction <m>(-x,-y,-z)</m> is back towards the origin.
        We can recover the magnitude by taking the length of the
        vector.
        <me>
          |F| = \frac{MG}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{x^2
          +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{x^2 +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{r^2}
