        Evaluate this multiple integral. You don't need to show all
        the single-variable steps, but give some comment on the
        general technique for each single variable integral. (4)

        Consider a parabolic square pyramid. That is, the pyramid has
        height <m>h</m> and a square base with side length <m>b</m>.
        However, moving up the pyramid at height <m>z</m>, the side
        length of the square changes quadratically. If <m>s</m> is the
        side length, this is expressed as <m>s(z) = \frac{b}{h^2} (h^2
        - z^2)</m>. Calculate the volume of such a parabolic square
        pyramid with height <m>9</m> and base side length <m>9</m>. (8)

        Integrate the function <m>f(x,z,y) = xyz</m> over a unit ball
        in <m>\RR^3</m>. Explain why the answer is reasonable as a
        hypervolume in <m>\RR^4</m>. (6)

        Integrate the function <m>f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z</m> over
        the portion of the interval <m>I = [0,2] \times [0,2] \times
        [0,2]</m> which lies below the plane <m>x + y + z = 2</m>. (6)

        What are the bounds of integration (in cartesian coordinates)
        for the 3-sphere <m>S^3</m> in <m>\RR^4</m>? What about
        <m>S^4</m> in <m>\RR^5</m>? <m>S^{n-1}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>?

        A hypercone in <m>\RR^n</m> with radius <m>r</m> and height
        <m>h</m> is an object which starts with a <m>2</m>-sphere of
        radius <m>r</m> in the <m>xyz</m> <m>3</m>-space. Then
        moving from <m>w=0</m> to <m>w=h</m>, there are spheres with
        smaller and smaller radii (like the circles forming a normal
        cone) up to <m>w=h</m> where the cone has shrunk to a point.
        Calculate the hypervolume of a hypercone in <m>\RR^4</m> with
        radius <m>4</m> and height <m>4</m>. (In the integral, you'll
        have an arctangent term where the argument evaluates to
        division by zero. Approach this with a limit as <m>a
        \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>, using the fact that arctangent has
        horizontal asymptoties and the value of arctangent is
        well-defined as its arguments go to infinity. (8)
