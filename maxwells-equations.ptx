    <title>19th Century Electromagnetic Observations</title>
    <p>
      A very general setup in physics is to observe the interactions
      of a system, write down a differential equation which describes
      those interactions, and try to solve the DE to find a function
      which will predict future action. In vector calculus, those
      differential equations are almost always stated interms of the
      <m>\nabla</m> operator. The origin of <m>\nabla</m> and the
      vector caculus was the attempt to understand electricity and
      magnetism in the later part of the 19th century. In the
      investigation of electricity and magentism in the 19th century,
      several important experimental observations were made by a
      number of different scientists and engineers.
      <ul>
        <li>

            Electric charge exists and creates an electric field.

            Flow of electric charge is possible (current).

        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic charge only comes in dipoles <mdash/> isolated
            magnetic charge is impossible. Magnetic dipoles create
            magnetic fields.

        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic and electric fields interact.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A current (moving electric charge) through a wire creates
            a magnetic field.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the wire is wrapped into a solenoid, it creates a field
            inside the coil which obeys a RHR.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Transformers can be built out of two solenoids: the first
            generates a magnetic field, which induces electric flow in
            the second.

            Electric fields act on any charged particles by attracting
            or repelling them.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic fields act only on moving charged particles and
            induce torque to change the direction of movement.

      Both static situations (electric and magnetic) produce fields
      and forces on charged particle. The action on charged particle

      law. If <m>q</m> is a charged particle travelling with velocity
      <m>v</m>, then the force satisfies this law.

      These observations give us the first presentation of Maxwell's
      equations: the presentation via differential operators. There
      are four equations: two for statics, which calculate divergence
      of the fields, and two for dynmanics, which calculate curl of
      the fields.

    <title>Gauss-Green-Stokes and Maxwell's Equations</title>
    <p>
      Some of the 19th century electro-magnetic observations directly
      measured charge, field and current, leading to the equations in
      the previous section. However, often the fields are difficult
      to measure directly; instead, their flux through various
      surfaces can be measured in the laboratory. To that end, we
      want a restatement of Maxwell's equations using the flux of
      fields, not just the fields themselves. We can apply Gauss' and
      Stokes' theorem to Maxwell's equation to get this second
      presentation. Let <m>D</m> be a solid region of space and
      <m>\sigma</m> a parametric surface (not necessarily the boundary
      of <m>D</m>). We define four new symbols.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>Q_D</m> is the total charge in the solid region
            <m>D</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>I_\sigma</m> is the total current flowing through a
            surface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\Phi_{E,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>E</m> through
            <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\Phi_{B,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>B</m> through
            <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>\sigma</m> is the bounding surface for the region
      <m>D</m>, then we can apply Gauss' theorem to the field
      <m>E</m>.
      <me>
        \Phi_{E,\sigma} = \int_\sigma E \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot
        E dV = \int_D \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} dV =
        \frac{Q_D}{\epsilon_0}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can do the same for <m>B</m>, remembering that <m>\nabla
      \cdot B = 0</m>.
      <me>
        \Phi_{B,\sigma} = \int_\sigma B \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot
        B dV = \int_D 0 dV = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>\sigma</m> be any surface (not the boundary of
      <m>D</m>) and let <m>\gamma</m> be its boundary. We can think
      of <m>\gamma</m> as a loop of wire, and <m>\sigma</m> the
      surface inside the loop. The line integral of <m>E</m> along
      the wire is the work done on by the field moving electrons along
      the wire. We can use Stokes' to calculate the line integral.
      <me>
        \int_\gamma E \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times E) \cdot
        dA = - \int_\sigma \frac{\del B}{\del t} = -\frac{\del}{\del
        t} \Phi_{B,\sigma}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking the other way around, this tells us the flux through
      the wire of the magnetic field induced by the current. If the
      loop is now a series of loops in a solenoid, the flux adds up,
      so more loops gives move surface area, hence more flux, hence a
      greater induced magnetic field. In an electric transformer we
      adjust the ingoing and outgoing current by having different
      numbers of coils on each solenoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      For magnetic field, we have also have a Stokes' theorem
      calculation.
      <me>
        \int_\gamma B \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times B) \cdot
        dA = \int_\sigma \mu_0 J \cdot dA + \int_\sigma \mu_0
        \epsilon_0 \frac{\del E}{\del t} = \mu_0 I_\sigma + \mu_0
        \epsilon_0 \frac{\del}{\del t} \Phi_{E, \sigma}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can put these all together into the second form of Maxwell's
      equations. In the first part, <m>\sigma</m> is the closed
      boundary of <m>D</m>, in the second part, <m>\sigma</m> is an
      open surface with boundary <m>\gamma</m>.

      This is a difficult system of differential equations, but it
      does have a solution. Therefore, at least mathematically, we
      can have electic and magnetic field existing in a vacuum, even
      without any charge, current, or magnetic dipoles. We're going
      to do some work to try to solve this system of DEs. In what

      This is a familiar number: <m>c</m>, the speed of light. And
      light is exactly what this wave is: propogation of
      electromagnetic fields through a vacuum is light. At the time
      of Maxwell, light was not understood as electromagnetic
      radiation. Maxwell argued that his system predicted the
      electromagnetic nature of light, which was eventually proved

      permittivity, premeability and the speed of light) is an
      important fact about the universe.
