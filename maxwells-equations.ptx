    <title>19th Century Electromagnetic Observations</title>
    <p>
      A very general setup in physics is to observe the interactions of a system,
      write down a differential equation which describes those interactions,
      and try to solve the DE to find a function which will predict future action.
      In vector calculus,
      those differential equations are almost always stated interms of the <m>\nabla</m> operator.
      The origin of <m>\nabla</m> and the vector caculus was the attempt to understand electricity and magnetism in the later part of the 19th century.
      In the investigation of electricity and magentism in the 19th century,
      several important experimental observations were made by a number of different scientists and engineers.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Electric charge exists and creates an electric field.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Flow of electric charge is possible
            (current).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic charge only comes in dipoles <mdash/> isolated magnetic charge is impossible.
            Magnetic dipoles create magnetic fields.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic and electric fields interact.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A current (moving electric charge) through a wire creates a magnetic field.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the wire is wrapped into a solenoid,
            it creates a field inside the coil which obeys a RHR.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Transformers can be built out of two solenoids:
            the first generates a magnetic field,
            which induces electric flow in the second.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Electric fields act on any charged particles by attracting or repelling them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Magnetic fields act only on moving charged particles and induce torque to change the direction of movement.

      We label the electric field <m>E</m> and the magnetic field <m>B</m>.
      In terms of the fields, we can restate the observations.
      The first set of observations involve statics.

      Both static situations

            also satisfies a differential equation.

      These observations give us the first presentation of Maxwell's equations:
      the presentation via differential operators.
      There are four equations:
      two for statics, which calculate divergence of the fields,
      and two for dynmanics, which calculate curl of the fields.

    <title>Gauss-Green-Stokes and Maxwell's Equations</title>
    <p>
      Some of the 19th century electro-magnetic observations directly measured charge,
      field and current, leading to the equations in the previous section.
      However, often the fields are difficult to measure directly;
      instead, their flux through various surfaces can be measured in the laboratory.
      To that end,
      we want a restatement of Maxwell's equations using the flux of fields,
      not just the fields themselves.
      We can apply Gauss' and Stokes' theorem to Maxwell's equation to get this second presentation.
      Let <m>D</m> be a solid region of space and <m>\sigma</m> a parametric surface
      (not necessarily the boundary of <m>D</m>).
      We define four new symbols.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>Q_D</m> is the total charge in the solid region <m>D</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>I_\sigma</m> is the total current flowing through a surface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\Phi_{E,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>E</m> through <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\Phi_{B,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>B</m> through <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>\sigma</m> is the bounding surface for the region <m>D</m>,
      then we can apply Gauss' theorem to the field <m>E</m>.
      <me>
        \Phi_{E,\sigma} = \int_\sigma E \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot E dV = \int_D \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} dV = \frac{Q_D}{\epsilon_0}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can do the same for <m>B</m>,
      remembering that <m>\nabla \cdot B = 0</m>.
      <me>
        \Phi_{B,\sigma} = \int_\sigma B \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot B dV = \int_D 0 dV = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>\sigma</m> be any surface
      (not the boundary of <m>D</m>)
      and let <m>\gamma</m> be its boundary.
      We can think of <m>\gamma</m> as a loop of wire,
      and <m>\sigma</m> the surface inside the loop.
      The line integral of <m>E</m> along the wire is the work done on by the field moving electrons along the wire.
      We can use Stokes' to calculate the line integral.
      <me>
        \int_\gamma E \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times E) \cdot dA = - \int_\sigma \frac{\del B}{\del t} = -\frac{\del}{\del t} \Phi_{B,\sigma}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking the other way around,
      this tells us the flux through the wire of the magnetic field induced by the current.
      If the loop is now a series of loops in a solenoid, the flux adds up,
      so more loops gives move surface area,
      hence more flux, hence a greater induced magnetic field.
      In an electric transformer we adjust the ingoing and outgoing current by having different numbers of coils on each solenoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      For magnetic field, we have also have a Stokes' theorem calculation.
      <me>
        \int_\gamma B \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times B) \cdot dA = \int_\sigma \mu_0 J \cdot dA + \int_\sigma \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del E}{\del t} = \mu_0 I_\sigma + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del}{\del t} \Phi_{E, \sigma}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can put these all together into the second form of Maxwell's equations.
      In the first part,
      <m>\sigma</m> is the closed boundary of <m>D</m>, in the second part,
      <m>\sigma</m> is an open surface with boundary <m>\gamma</m>.

    <title>Maxwell's Equations in a Vacuum</title>
    <p>
      A strange question:
      what happens we we consider Maxwell's equation in a vacuum with no external influence?
      Without charge or current,
      the differential form of the equations is as follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>\nabla \cdot B \amp  = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>\nabla \cdot E \amp  = 0</mrow>

        <mrow>\nabla \times E \amp  = \frac{-\del B}{\del t}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a difficult system of differential equations,
      but it does have a solution.
      Therefore, at least mathematically,
      we can have electic and magnetic field existing in a vacuum,
      even without any charge, current, or magnetic dipoles.
      We're going to do some work to try to solve this system of DEs.
      In what looks like random calculations, let's dive in.
      <md>
        <mrow>\nabla \times (\nabla \times E) \amp  = \nabla \times -\frac{\del B}{\del t} = \frac{-\del}{\del t} (\nabla \times B)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = - \frac{\del}{\del t} \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del E}{\del t}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del^2 E}{\del t^2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the identity <m>\nabla \times (\nabla \times E) = \nabla (\nabla \cdot E) - \nabla^2 E</m>,
      where the Laplacian here means the Laplacian of each of the three components of <m>E</m>.
      The first term is <m>0</m>, since <m>\nabla \cdot E =0</m>,
      so we get <m>\nabla \times( \nabla \times E) = -\nabla^2 E</m>.
      Let's put this new piece together with the previous calculation.
      <me>
        \nabla^2 E = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del^2 E}{\del t^2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar calculation exists for <m>B</m>.
      <me>
        \nabla^2 B = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del^2 B}{\del t^2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are wave equations,
      so we expect that we will have wave solutions for <m>E</m> and <m>B</m>.
      The full solutions are very general,
      so lets make some assumptions which are justified by observation.
      First, we assume <m>E \perp B</m>.
      Second, let <m>z</m> be the direction of propogation of the waves,
      so the waves themselves are only in the <m>xy</m> plane.
      By readjusting coordinates,
      we can assume <m>E = (E_1,0,0)</m> and <m>B = (0, B_2,0)</m>.
      Then we have two differential equations in the scalar fields <m>E_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del z^2} E_1 \amp  = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del^2 E_1}{\del t^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del z^2} B_2 \amp  = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del^2 B_2}{\del t^2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll note solve these DEs, but they have the following reasonable solutions.
      <md>
        <mrow>E_1 \amp  = a_1 \cos \left( z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}t \right) + b_1 \sin \left( z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}t \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>B_2 \amp  = a_2 \cos \left( z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}t \right) + b_2 \sin \left( z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}t \right)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are waves propogating in the <m>z</m> direction.
      The coefficient of <m>t</m> is the wave speed.
      What is this coefficient?
      <me>
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \frac{1}{8.86\times 10^{-12} \cdot 4\pi \times 10^{-9}} = 2.997 \times 10^8 m/s
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The units also work out to recover a velocity.
      <me>
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{m \cdot kg}{s^2 A^2} \frac{s^4 A^2}{m^3 kg}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{m^2}}} = \frac{m}{s}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a familiar number: <m>c</m>, the speed of light.
      And light is exactly what this wave is:
      propogation of electromagnetic fields through a vacuum is light.
      At the time of Maxwell,
      light was not understood as electromagnetic radiation.
      Maxwell argued that his system predicted the electromagnetic nature of light,
      which was eventually proved correct.
      The relationship in the basic constants
      (the permittivity, premeability and the speed of light)
      is an important fact about the universe.
