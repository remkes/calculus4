        Calculate the integral curves for this vector field. (You can
        solve these differential equations by guessing, since the
        patterns of the derivatives are familiar, or as separable
        equations.) (5)

        Prove the following product rule identity where <m>f</m> is a
        scalar field in <m>\RR^3</m> and <m>F</m> is a vector field in
