    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to define and access tangent spaces for manifolds.
      We will start by generalizing tangents of parametric objects.
      For a parametric curve <m>\gamma</m>,
      we calculated <m>\gamma^\prime</m>,
      which was the tangent vector (a local direction vector).
      All multiples of <m>\gamma^\prime</m> gave the tangent line to the curve.
      For a parametric surface <m>\sigma</m>,
      we calculated <m>\sigma_u</m> and <m>\sigma_v</m>
      (again, two local direction vectors).
      All linear combinations of <m>\sigma_u</m> and
      <m>\sigma_v</m> give a plane which is tangent to the surface.
      The cross product, of course,
      gave the normal to that tangent plane.
      In either case,
      we see that the tangents are given by derivatives of the parametrization functions.
      For manifolds,
      parametrization functions are now the coordinate functions,
      leading to this definition.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a manifold of dimension <m>k</m>.
          Let <m>D</m> be a simply connected open set in <m>\RR^k</m> with
          <m>\phi:D \rightarrow U</m> a coordinate function on <m>M</m>.
          Let <m>u_i</m> be the variables of <m>\RR^k</m> on the set <m>D</m>.
          For each <m>u_i</m>,
          the partial derivative <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m> is a
          <term>tangent vector</term>
          to the manifold (as a local direction vector at a point <m>\phi(u_1, u_2, \ldots,
          u_k)</m>).
          The <term>tangent space</term> <m>T_p</m> at a point <m>p \in U</m> is the span all of the tangent vectors
          <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m> where <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.

    <title>Tangents as Differential Operators</title>
    <p>
      There is some strange but conventional notation for tangent vectors to manifolds.
      Using the conditions of the previous definition,
      instead of <m>\frac{\del \phi}{\del u_i}</m>,
      we often simply write <m>\del_i</m> for the tangent vector.
      If we want to specify the point <m>p</m> on the manifold,
      we write <m>\del_i(p)</m>.
      Notice, in this definition,
      that the subscript <m>i</m> refers to the coordinates defined by the coordinate function <m>\phi</m>:
      the coordinate function is always implicit in tangent vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something a little deeper going on with this notation.
      Recall the notion of a directional derivative in Calculus III: for a scalar field on an open set in <m>\RR^n</m>,
      we can differentiate the scalar field in any local direction.
      The partial derivatives of a scalar field were nothing more than the directional derivatives in the directions where only one coordinate changed.
      In this sense, the directional derivative give <em>all</em>
      the possible derivative of scalar fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let <m>f</m> be a differentiable scalar field on a manifold <m>M</m>.
      According to <xref ref="def-differentiable-scalar-field">definition</xref>,
      the composition <m>f \circ \phi</m> with any coordinate function must be a differentiable function on <m>D</m>,
      the domain of <m>\phi</m>.
      <m>D</m> has coordinate <m>u_i</m>,
      so we can take the derivative <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i} f \circ \phi</m>.
      These are the derivative of the scalar field on the manifold
      (at least, in this particular chart).
      Any linear combination of these partials is a
      <em>directional derivative</em> of <m>f</m>.
      <me>
        \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \frac{\del}{\del u_i} f \circ \phi
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This directional derivative is the derivative in the direction <m>\sum_{i=1}^k a_i \frac{\del}{\del u_i} \phi</m> on the manifold,
      which is a tangent direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this sense,
      we can think of tangent directions on the manifold as differential operators on scalar field,
      using the idea of a directional derivative.
      (Unlike the directional derivatives in Calculus III, we don't insist that the direction is a unit vector.
      Any non-zero vector still produces a differential operator.)
      This is a very common approch to tangents to manifold:
      instead of thinking of them geometrically as vector,
      we think of them as differentiable operators.
      This explains some of the notation:
      the basis differential operators are the partials <m>\frac{\del}{\del u_i}</m>,
      which are succinctly written <m>\del_i</m>.
      This perspective will be very important for our work in future sections on making constructions agree on coordinate chart overlaps,
      where we can use the chain rule to understand how these differential operators change via transition functions.

      For parametric curves, we insisted that <m>\gamma^\prime(t) \neq 0</m>.
      Similarly, for parametric surfaces,
      we insisted on non-zero normals.
      In either case,
      we wanted to make sure the tangent spaces to the parametric objects were well defined and had the same dimension as the parametric object.
      For manifolds, we have a similar restriction.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A manifold <m>M</m> of dimension <m>k</m> is called <term>non-singular</term>
          if all of its tangent spaces <m>T_p</m> are vector spaces of dimension <m>k</m> (i.e., copies of <m>\RR^k</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Many definitions of manifolds assume the non-singular condition.
      Our definition also implicity guarantees non-singular manifolds,
      becaused we assumed the coordinate functions were <m>C^1</m> functions.
      Smooth manifolds are also non-singular.
      (There is some variance in the literature in the terminology here;
      in some contexts, smooth and non-singular are synonymous.
      I've chosen a particular convention for these notes where smooth is a stronger condition.)

          Consider the second parametrization of the sphere,
          with these coordinate functions.

        <p>
          Here are the derivatives of <m>\phi_1</m>.
          <md>

        <p>
          Evaluated at an <m>(u,v) \in D(0,r)</m>,
          these give two local tangent directions to the hemisphere,
          much like a parametric surface.
          On the overlap with <m>\phi_3</m>,
          there would be different local descriptions of the tangent vectors,
          but the tangent planes that they span would be the same.
          Here are the derivatives of <m>\phi_3</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del u} \phi_3 \amp  = \left(1,\frac{-u}{\sqrt{r^2-u^2-v^2}}, 0 \right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del v} \phi_3 \amp  = \left(0,\frac{-v}{\sqrt{r^2-u^2-v^2}}, 1 \right)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's look at a specific point.
          <m>\phi_1 \left( 0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \left( 0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right)</m>.
          This the same as the point <m>\phi_3 \left(0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right)</m>.
          Now let's evaluate the tangents at these points.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del u} \phi_1 \left(0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \amp  = (1,0,0)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del v} \phi_1 \left(0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \amp  = \left( 0,1,\frac{\frac{-r}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{r}{\sqrt{2}}} \right) = (1,0,-1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del u} \phi_1 \times \frac{\del}{\del v} \phi_1 \amp = (0, -1, 0)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del u} \phi_3 \left(0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \amp  = (1,0,0)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del v} \phi_3 \left(0, \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \amp  = (0,-1,1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\del}{\del u} \phi_3 \times \frac{\del}{\del v} \phi_3 \amp  = (0, -1, 0)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We see, even though there is a difference in local tangents,
          the normal is the same and we get the same local tangent plane.
