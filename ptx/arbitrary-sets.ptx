  <title>Integration over Arbitrary Sets</title>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a geometrically interesting example.
        The function <m>f(x,y) = a - \frac{a(|x-y| + |x+y|)}{2b}</m> over the interval
        <m>[-b.b] \times [-b,b]</m> describes a square pyramid with height <m>a</m> and side length <m>2b</m>.
        What is the volume of such a pyramid?
        Doing the integral directly is difficult with the various evaluations of the absolute value terms.
        However, we can integrate over one quarter of pyramid with the interval <m>[0,b] \times [0,b]</m>,
        then multiply by 4 to get the entire area.
        However, this doesn't solve the problem with the absolute value terms.
        We need to split the domain into regions where <m>x>y</m> and <m>x\lt y</m>.
        In the interval <m>[0,b] \times [0,b]</m>,
        those two regions are triangles,
        and we don't know how to deal with integration over a triangle.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Integration over intervals isn't sufficient;
    we need to integrate over any set <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>
    (at least, any reasonable set).
    How do we do this?
    As with many aspects of calculus, there is a formal,
    proper definition which turns out to be difficult to work with.
    Afer the definition,
    we seek set of techniques which allow us to do calculations.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        The <term>characteristic function of <m>S</m></term>
        is defined as follows, where <m>v \in \RR^n</m>.
        <me>
          \chi_S (v) : = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 \amp  v \in S \\ 0 \amp  v \notin S \end{matrix} \right.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The characteristic function is very simple:
    it has value <m>1</m> on the set <m>S</m> and <m>0</m> everywhere else.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m> which is contained in an interval <m>I</m>.
        <m>S</m> is called a <term>integrable set</term>
        if the following integral exists.
        <me>
          \int_I \chi_S dV
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Almost all sets we will work with are integrable.
    Sets which are not integrable are very strange sets
    (at least, for doing anything geometric).
    The archetypical example is <m>\QQ \subset \RR</m>:
    <m>\QQ</m> is not an integrable subset of <m>\RR</m>.
    As we proceed,
    we won't worry too much about integrability since all reasonable geoemtric sets are integrable.
    In particular, every open subset of <m>\RR^n</m> is integrable.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a integrable subset of <m>\RR^n</m> with
        <m>S \subset I</m> for some interval <m>I</m>.
        Let <m>f: S \rightarrow \RR</m> be an function which can be extended to an integrable function <m>\tilde{f}</m> on <m>I</m>.
        Then the integral of <m>f</m> over <m>S</m> is defined as:
        <me>
          \int_S f dV = \int_I \tilde{f} \chi_S dV
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The characteristic function removes all values of <m>f</m> outside the set <m>S</m>,
    so all that the integral measure are the values of <m>f</m> over <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we pointed out before, this is almost entirely useless for calculation.
    We need a better technique;
    a version of iterated integrals for arbitrary subsets.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's return to the square pyramid situation.
        We wanted to integrate over two triangles in the interval <m>[0,b] \times [0,b]</m>,
        seperated by the line <m>x=y</m>.
        We're going to try for a similar strategy as for intervals:
        we want to interate single variable integrals.
        However, now we allow the bounds of integration to include the other variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, we can describe the first triangle
        (where <m>y\lt x</m>)
        by saying that <m>x \in [0,b]</m>, then,
        once we've set an <m>x</m> value, <m>y \in [0, x]</m>.
        In this order,
        the <m>y</m> variable depends on the <m>x</m> for its bounds.
        The integral over this triangle is now an interated integral.
        <me>
          \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^b \int_0^x f(x,y) dy dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We could have reversed the order.
        If we have <m>y \in [0,b]</m> then the condition <m>y\lt x</m> means that <m>x \in [y,b]</m>.
        <me>
          \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^b \int_y^b f(x,y) dx dy
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's now evaluate the square pyramid integral.
        The function was <m>f(x,y) = a - \frac{a(|x-y| + |x+y|)}{2b}</m>.
        On the triangle in <m>[0,b] \times [0,b]</m> where <m>y\lt x</m>,
        the absolute values are <m>|x-y| = x-y</m> and <m>|x+y| = x+y</m>,
        so the function is <m>a - \frac{a(x-y+x+y)}{2b} = a - \frac{2ax}{2b} = a - \frac{ax}{b}</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_T f(x,y) dA \amp  = \int_0^b \int_0^x a - \frac{ax}{b} dy dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^b \left. ay - \frac{axy}{b} \right|_0^x dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^b ax - \frac{ax^2}{b} dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \left. \frac{ax^2}{2} - \frac{ax^3}{3b} \right|_0^b</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{ab^2}{2} - \frac{ab^3}{3b} = \frac{ab^2}{2} - \frac{ab^2}{3} = \frac{ab^2}{6}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This measures one eighth of the total pyramid,
        so the total volume is <m>\frac{4ab^2}{3}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

        This technique also allows us to derive the volume of a sphere.
        We can think of the top half of a sphere as the volume under the graph of <m>f(x,y) = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 - y^2}</m>.
        However, it is only the volume over the circle
        <m>x^2 + y^2 = r^2</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane.
        It we take the quarter of that circle in the positive quadrant,
        let <m>D</m> be the region where
        <m>x \in [0,r]</m> and <m>y \in [0, \sqrt{r^2-x^2}]</m>.
        One eighth of the sphere is measure by the following iterated integral.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_D f(x,y) dA \amp  = \int_0^r \int_0^{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}} \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 - y^2} dy dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^r \left( \frac{y}{2} \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 - y^2} + \left. \frac{(r^2 - x^2)}{2} \arcsin \left( \frac{y}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \right) \right|_x^{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \right) dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^r \frac{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}}{2} \sqrt{ r^2 - x^2 - (r^2 - x^2)} + \frac{(r^2-x^2)}{2} \arcsin \left( \frac{ \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \right) dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^r \frac{r^2 - x^2}{2} \frac{\pi}{2} dx = \int_0^r \frac{\pi (r^2-x^2)}{4} dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \left. \frac{\pi r^2x}{4} - \frac{\pi x^3}{12} \right|_0^r</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\pi r^3}{4} - \frac{\pi r^3}{12} = \frac{\pi r^3}{6}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying by <m>8</m> gives <m>\frac{8\pi r^3}{6} = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}</m>,
        which is the familiar expression for the volume of a sphere.
        Of couse, we could have reversed the order and taken <m>y \in [0,r]</m> and
        <m>x \in [0, \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}]</m> and repeated very similar steps to also get the same answer.

        We can also calcualte the volume of a cone of height <m>h</m> and radius <m>r</m>.
        We integrate over the same circle of radius <m>r</m>,
        but the function is <m>f(x,y) = h - \frac{h}{r} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</m>.
        (This function can be derived by looking at similar triangles in vertical sections of the cone.)
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_D f(x,y) dA \amp  = 4 \int_0^r \int_0^{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \left( h - \frac{h}{r} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \right) dy dx</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The cone integral is quite difficult to do directly;
        for now, we'll leave it.
        We will return to this integral when we do change of variables.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The general form of an interated integral starts with constant bounds on the outside variable.
    Then inside bounds can include functions of variables from the outside integrals.
    If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are function,
    we have two general forms in <m>\RR^3</m>.

        Let <m>S</m> be a integrable set in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Then the size (area, volume,

  </definition>
  <p>
    Note that this is a <em>definition</em>:
    we have no other way, in general,
    to understand the size of sets.
    This definition is the start of another whole branch of mathematics called measure theory.
    It deals with various ways of measuring sizes of sets in topological spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    We mentioned earlier that all open sets are integrable.
    We have another simplifying theorem that ensure we only need to integrate over open sets.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be an integrable set in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Let <m>S^0</m> be the set of interior points of <m>S</m>.
        Let <m>f: S \rightarrow \RR</m> be an integrable function.
        Then
        <me>
          \int_S f dV = \int_{S^0} f dV
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    This proposition means that we can ignore any inconveniences which happen on the boundaries of sets. (Note that we still do need limits for improper integrals,
    when the value of a function approaches <m>\infty</m> near the boundary of a set).
    The proposition also means that sets which are essentially of lower dimensions do not matter in integration.
    If we are integrating over subsets of <m>\RR^3</m>,
    then integrating over points,
    line and planes amounts to nothing.
    Points, lines,
    and planes don't have any interior points in <m>\RR^3</m>,
    so we might as well be integrating over the empty set,
    which gives zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than ignoring boundaries and smaller dimensional pieces,
    our approach to general sets is to break them up into pieces.
    It is a general result in topology,
    which we won't get into here,
    that any (reasonable) set can be broken up in to pieces
    (possibly infinitely many)
    where the previous style of integral applies.
    We can also be creative: for example,
    we could integrate over a larger circle and subtract the integral over a small circle to integrate over a ring-shaped domain.
    In these various ways we can set up integrals over any (reasonable) subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.

        There isn't any one system of iterated integrals that covers this region;

        Here is an odd application of multiple integration.
        We know that <m>e^{-x^2}</m> has no elementary antiderivative.
        Therefore, the intergal
        <me>
          A = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx
        </me>
        cannot be evaluated directly.
        However, this is a very important integral:
        <m>e^{-x^2}</m> is the normal distribution and, in Statistics,
        we need to integrate it frequently.
        We'll use integrals over <m>\RR^2</m>, strangely enough,
        to calculate this integral by squaring the single variable integra.
        <md>
          <mrow>A \amp  = 2 \int_{0}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx</mrow>
          <mrow>A^2 \amp  = \left( 2 \int_{0}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx \right) \left(2 \int_{0}^\infty e^{-y^2} dy \right)</mrow>

        The second integral uses a new variables since variables of integration only matter inside the integral.
        Then we can combine the two integrals.

        Now we are going to do a substitution in the <m>y</m> variable.
        Treating the <m>x</m> variable as a constnat,
        we replace <m>y</m> with <m>y = xs</m> so that <m>dy = x ds</m>.
        If <m>y=0</m> then <m>s=0</m> and as <m>y \rightarrow \infty</m>,
        <m>s \rightarrow \infty</m>,
        so the bound for <m>s</m> remain the same as the bounds for <m>y</m>.
        Remember, <m>x</m> is a constant through this whole substitution.

        We recover the area under the bell curve: <m>\sqrt{\pi}</m>.
        It's a very strange result.
        However, if you taken any statistics and worked on normal distributions,
        likely you will recall the presence of these strange <m>\sqrt{\pi}</m> terms.
        Now we know they are present to normalize the area
        (since we want a probability function to have area one under its graph).
