  <title>Pullbacks</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When we worked with parametric curves and parametric surfaces,
      there were two kinds of coordinates:
      coordinates in the parameter space (<m>t</m> for curves,
      <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> for surfaces) and coordinates in the ambient space
      (<m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> in <m>\RR^3</m>).
      We needed to work with both sets of coordinates to property understand these parametric objects.
      In line and flux integrals, we had to evaluate the vector fields,
      given in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> ambient coordinates,
      in terms of the parameters, so that we could integrate in those parameters.
      We developed an interplay between the ambient coordinates and the parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>U</m> is an open set in a dimension <m>k</m> manifold in <m>\RR^n</m>,
      then we like have two sets of coordinates:
      local coordaintes (parameters) on the manifold <m>u_i</m> for
      <m>1 \leq i \leq k</m> coming from the domain <m>D(0,r)</m> of a coordinate function;
      and the ambient coordinates <m>x_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      In this section,
      we are going to build a general understanding of the interaction between the two sets of coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we work on a manifold under with dimensions <m>k</m>,
      the highest degree differential form on <m>U</m> is a k-form.
      In the local coordinates <m>u_1, \ldots, u_k</m>,
      this form is simply <m>f(u_1, \ldots,
      u_k) du_1 \wedge du_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge du_k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this form may also be expressed in terms of the ambient coordinates
      <m>x_1, \ldots,
      x_n</m>. (Note that <m>n \geq k</m>:
      there may be more of these coordinates than the parameters!) The form can be expressed in terms of wedges of <m>k</m> different <m>dx_i</m> in the ambient coordinates.
      For example, if <m>k=2</m> and <m>n=3</m>,
      then the two form could be
      <m>\omega = (x^2yz) dy \wedge dz</m> or <m>\omega = (x+y+z) dx \wedge dz</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, a k-form in the ambient coordinates can be a wedge of any subset consisting of exactly <m>k</m> of the <m>x_i</m>.
      <me>
        \omega_k = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) dx_{j_1} \wedge dx_{j_2} \wedge, \ldots \wedge dx_{j_k}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For parametric curves and surfaces,
      we replaced the ambient coordinates with the parameters using the definition of the curves and surface.
      When we went to integrate,
      we used a Jacobian term to relate the integral of the ambient coordinates to the integral of the parameters.
      For the curve,
      that Jacobian was <m>|\gamma^\prime(t)|</m>, and for a surface,
      that Jacobian was <m>|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a manifold, we will do the same.
      We will replace the ambient coordinates with the local coordinates using the coordinate functions.
      This is a change of coordinates:
      ambient going to local.
      Since the local coordinates are the <em>domain</em>
      of the coordinate functions,
      this is sort-of going backwards with the coordinate functions.
      For this reason, we call the operation a <em>pullback</em>
      of the differential form.
      Like the curve and surface case,
      we will need a Jacobian for this pullback.

          Let <m>u_1, \ldots, u_k</m> be its local coordinates and
          <m>\phi: D \rightarrow U</m> is coordinate function.
          Let <m>\omega_k</m> be a differential k-form expressed in the ambient coordinates
          (where the <m>j_i</m> are any subset of exactly <m>k</m> of the ambient coordinates).

          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The intermediate terms is the <term>Jacobian</term> of the pullback.
          It is defined as the determinant of a particular matrix of partial derivatives of the coordinate function.
          <me>
            \frac{\del(x_{j_1}, x_{j_2}, \ldots, x_{j_k})}{\del(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k)} = \left| \begin{matrix} \frac{\del \phi_{j_1}}{\del u_1} \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_1}}{\del u_2} \amp \ldots \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_1}}{\del u_j} \\ \frac{\del \phi_{j_2}}{\del u_1} \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_2}}{\del u_2} \amp \ldots \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_2}}{\del u_k} \\ \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \vdots \\ \frac{\del \phi_{j_k}}{\del u_1} \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_k}}{\del u_2} \amp \ldots \amp \frac{\del \phi_{j_k}}{\del x_k} \end{matrix} \right|

      Note that these vertical lines indicate the <em>determinant</em>
      of the matrix, not the absolute value.
      We <em>do not</em> take absolute values for Jacobians anymore!
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="jacobians">
    <title>Jacobians, Orientation, Absolute Values and
    Differential Forms</title>
    <p>
      The fact that we don't have absolute values of Jacobians now,
      but we did before, deserves some special attention.
      This difference gets right to the heart of the use and importance of differential forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we defined single,
      double and triple integrals over intervals in <m>\RR^1</m>,
      <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> (respectively),
      we essentially did so <em>without regard for orientation</em>.
      Orientation, for regions of Euclidian space,
      is determined by the ordering of the variables
      (or, equivalently,
      by the relative positions of the positive axes to each other).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fubini's theorem
      (<xref ref="thm-fubini">Theorem</xref>)
      said that we could interchange the order of integration,
      under some mild assumptions on the function,
      and still produce the same result.
      The reason this works is that our notion of area/volume/hypervolume,
      encoded in the terms <m>dxdy</m>,
      <m>dxdydz</m> and similar, didn't care about the order of variables.
      It makes sense that <m>dxdy</m> and <m>dydx</m> both encode area,
      the same way that the area of a rectangle of height <m>a</m> and width <m>b</m> can be either
      <m>a \times b</m> or <m>b \times a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in Euclidean space,
      we could get away with this convention,
      ignoring the order or variables,
      and use a naive understanding of area/volume/hypervolume.
      But, when we used a transformation of Euclidean space to change variables,
      there was an effect on area/volume/hypervolume.
      Since these quantities are, by definition,
      positive, this effect needed to be a positive effect.
      Therefore, we needed to take the absolute value of Jacobian,
      so we don't introduce a negative scaling effect.
      Multiplying area by <m>-2</m> doesn't make sense in this context.
    </p>
    <p>
      For integration on manifolds,
      we don't have the luxury of ignoring orientation.
      Since everything is a parametrized object and we can only do calculus on parametrized objects via the coordinate functions,
      we need to care about orientation.
      We need to know the directions of curve.
      We need to know where the normals to surfaces are pointing.
      If we interchange variables,
      <m>x \mapsto y</m> and <m>y \mapsto x</m>,
      then the orientation changes and we should get a negative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work with differential forms.
      In the way they are constructed,
      we naturally have <m>dx \wedge dy = -dy \wedge dx</m> instead of <m>dx dy = dy dx</m>.
      Orientation is <em>built-in</em>
      to the very roots of differential forms.
      If we integrate a differential form over an open set in Euclidean space,
      we need to care around the order of variables.
      Area/volume/hypervolume become oriented quantities,
      which change in sign when we change orientation.
      We also should expect that Jacobians can be positive and negative.
      Therefore, quite naturally,
      we never see absolute values of Jacobians when working with differential forms.

    <title>Pullbacks and Covariance</title>
    <p>
      After that detour on Jacobians,
      let me restate the pullback definition.
      <me>
        \phi^* \omega^k = \left(f \circ \phi(u_1, \ldots u_k) \right) \frac{\del(x_{j_1}, x_{j_2}, \ldots, x_{j_k})}{\del(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k)} du_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge du_k
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      These pullbacks are, essentially,
      changes of variables by the function <m>\phi</m>.
      The <m>x_{j_i}</m> are the components of the function <m>\phi</m> which gives those coordinates in terms of the new variables <m>u_i</m>.
      Compare this with the change of variables expression for differential forms via a transition function.
      <me>
        f_1((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del u}{\del s} du + \frac{\del u}{\del t} dv \right] + f_2((T(s,t))) \left[ \frac{\del v}{\del s} ds + \frac{\del v}{\del t} dt \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The composition in the function is with <m>T</m> and the matrix action that produced the terms in square brackets used the matrix <m>J(T)</m>.
      It's hard to see directly, but there is a parallel structure here.
      We compose with a function (<m>\phi</m> or <m>T</m>) and then we use a the Jacobian matrix
      (or its determinant)
      to adjust the basis.
      This differed from the transformation of vector fields,
      where we composed with <m>T</m> but used the Jacobian of <m>T^{-1}</m>,
      not <m>T</m>.
      We called differential forms <em>covariant</em>
      and vector fields <em>contravariant</em> for these reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pullback is a <em>covariant</em> operation.
      We can perform pullbacks on differential forms only because they are also covariant.
      We cannot pullback a vector field,
      because it is not covariant.
      If we try, the contravariant nature of the field and the covariant nature of the pullback will mess up the agreement on the overlaps of charts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For vector fields in Euclidean space,
      or on parametric curves and surface,
      we can get around this because we never need to use multiple charts.
      When we start using manifolds and have multiple charts,
      this difficulty suddenly arises.
      And now, to anticipate the next section,
      we are going to use the pullback operation to define integration of differential forms.
      Since the pullback doesn't work for a vector field on a general manifold,
      we can't define their integrals.
      The natural objects to integrate on a manifold are differential forms,
      not vector fields.
