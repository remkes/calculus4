  <title>The Definite Integral</title>
  <p>
    The single-variable definite integral measures the area under the graph of a function.
    We also have graphs for multivariable functions.
    For a function of two variables,
    the graph is in <m>\RR^3</m> and there is volume under the grpah instead of area.
    For functions of three or more variables,
    the graphs are in higher dimensional spaces and enclose a hyper-volume.
    The definite integral asks for the value of this volume or hyper-volume.
  </p>
  <p>
    Single variable integration took place over intervals.
    We do the same for multi-variable integration,
    so we need intervals in <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An closed intevral <m>I</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is product of single-variable closed intervals.
        <me>
          I = [a_1,b_1] \times [a_2,b_2] \times \ldots \times [a_n,b_n]
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the subset of <m>\RR^n</m> consisting of all
        <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_n)</m> such that <m>a_1 \leq x_1 \leq b_1</m>,
        <m>a_2 \leq x_2, \leq b_2</m> and so on until <m>a_n \leq x_n \leq b_n</m>.
        In <m>\RR^2</m> it is a rectangle.
        In <m>\RR^3</m> it is a rectangular prism.
        Similarly, by using open interval, <m>(a,b)</m>,
        in the definition, we can define an open interval in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    For the single-variable integral,
    we partitioned the interval into <m>n</m> pieces.
    We can also partition these multi-variable intervals.
    In general, there are several ways to do so;
    one of the easiest is simply to divide each of the single variable intervals into <m>l</m> pieces.
    In <m>\RR^2</m>,
    this splits the rectangle into a checkerboard pattern,
    with <m>l^2</m> small rectangles.
    In <m>\RR^3</m>,
    it splits into <m>l^3</m> small rectangular prisms.
    In <m>\RR^n</m> there are <m>l^n</m> subdivisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we have a partition of <m>I</m> into <m>l^n</m> pieces,
    we can use the same limit process as the single variable integral.
    Let <m>x^*</m> be any point in each piece of the partition and estimate the (hyper-)volume over that piece of the interval by a rectangular (hyper-)volume.
    The height is <m>f(x^*)</m>.
    The (hyper-) volume of one pieces of our approximation is this height multiplied by the size of the small partition pieces,
    in the appropriate dimension.
    We can write <m>\Delta V</m> for this size,
    thinking of <m>V</m> for volume or hypervolume.
    Then we

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The integral of a function <m>f:I \rightarrow \RR</m> on an interval
        <m>I \subset \RR^n</m> is defined as the following limit,
        if it exists.
        If the limit exists, we say that <m>f</m> is <term>integrable</term>
        on the interval <m>I</m>.
        <me>
          \int_{I} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) dV = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{l^n} f(x^*) \Delta V
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In the multivariable integral,
    the <m>\Delta V</m> becomes an infinitesimal piece of area,
    volume or hypervolume <m>dV</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's specialize this to <m>\RR^2</m>.
    In <m>\RR^2</m>, we often write
    <m>\Delta A</m> and <m>dA</m> for area instead of volume.
    Consider an interval in <m>\RR^n</m>:
    <m>I = [a_1,b_1] \times [a_2,b_2]</m>.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^l \sum_{j=1}^l f(x_i^*,y_j^*) \Delta x \Delta y
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We've clarified the nature of the sum by seperating the indicies,
    counting the divisions of each single-variable interval.
    The points are also more clear:
    <m>x_i^*</m> is in the <m>i</m>th piece of
    <m>[a_1,b_1]</m> and <m>y_j^*</m> is in the <m>j</m>th piece of <m>[a_2,b_2]</m>.
    Finally, <m>\Delta x</m> is <m>\frac{b_1-a_1}{l}</m>
    <m>\Delta y</m> is <m>\frac{b_2-a_2}{l}</m>,
    and the product <m>\Delta x \Delta y</m>is area of each piece of the partion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same works in <m>\RR^3</m>, with three sums.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y,z) dV = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^l \sum_{j=1}^l \sum_{k=1}^l f(x_i^*,y_j^*,z_k^*) \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise in <m>\RR^n</m>, with <m>n</m> sums.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n) dV = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i_1=1}^l \sum_{i_2=1}^l \ldots \sum_{i_n=1}^l f(x_{1,i_1}^*,x_{2,i_2}^*, \ldots ,x_{n,i_n}^*) \Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 \ldots \Delta x_n
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    For single variable functions,
    the definite integral measured the area under the graph of the function over the interval <m>I</m>.
    Here the interpretation is the same,
    but the notion of size increases with dimension.
    For functions of two variables,
    the definite integral is the volume under the graph over the rectangle <m>I</m> in question.
    For functions of more than two variables,
    we get the hyper-volume under the graph and above the interval.

    There are several important similarities between the multi-variable definition and the familiar single-variable definition.
    Both are limits of approximation methods.
    All the core definitions of calculus involve some algebraic approximation and the limit of such a process.
    Multi-variable integrals are no different;
    the algebra is a bit more complicated to handle the higher dimensions,
    but the process is the same.
    Also, both definitions are very,
    very difficult to work with.
    We needed the fundamental theorem and many integration techniques to calculate single variable integrals.
    We will need similar theorems and techniques to calculate multivariable integrals.
  </p>
  <p>
    For single variable functions,
    if the limit defining the integral existed,
    we said the function was integralable.
    The same is true for multivariable functions.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>.
        Let <m>f: I \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function of <m>n</m> variables.
        If we can break the interval <m>I</m> up into finitely many pieces and if <m>f</m> is continuous on each of the pieces,
        we say the function is <term>piecewise continuous</term>.

        All piecewise continuous functions of several variables are integrable.

    There are, in fact, other functions which are also integrable.
    However, they can be difficult to construct.
    As an aside,
    there are also different notions of integrability and different definition of the integral.
    What we have discussed here is the Riemann integral,
    and this notion of integrability is Riemann-integrability.
    In higher mathematics,
    the most commonly used definition of the integral is a different definition,
    called the Lebesgue integral.
    It is also an approximation process,
    but it involve approximating the function with a special functions that only take finitely many values.
    The Lebesgue integral agrees with the Riemann integral on all Riemann-integrable functions.
    However, there are functions where the Lebesgue integral is defined but the limit in the Riemann integral fails to converge.
    It is interesting to observe that something as fundamental as the integral has multiple definitions and the choice of definitions has a real,
    measurable effect on our mathematics.
