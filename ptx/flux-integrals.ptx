  <title>Flux Integrals</title>
  <p>
    In addition to integrating scalars along surfaces,
    we also want to integrate vector fields.
    For the definition, we again look at line integrals.
    We took a dot product with the tangent to the curve to measure how much the field acts with or against the motion of the curve.
    For surfaces, we also take a dot product,
    but now with the normal of the surface.
    By doing so,
    we are measuring how much the vector field passes through the surface:
    if the dot product is large,
    the field direction is similar to the normal and almost perpendicular to the surface.
    If the dot product is small,
    the field moves almost in parallel with the surface,
    moving across it instead of through it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We used the dot product with the unit tangent to calculate a line integral.
    <me>
      \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds = \int_{\gamma} F \cdot T ds = \int_a^b F(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We need something similar to the unit tangent to calculate integrals of fields over surfaces.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> be a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m> defined over a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>.
        The <term>unit normal</term> of the surface is the vector <m>\frac{\sigma_u \times \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|}</m>.
        (Our convention that the normal is never zero helps to avoid division by zero in this definition.)

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> be a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m> defined over a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>.
        Let <m>F</m> be a vector field defined on a neighbourhood of the surface.
        The <term>flux integral</term> is defined to be the following integral.
        <me>
          \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA = \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first notation is more complete,
        but the second notation is conventional.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As with curve,
    we don't want to calculate with the intrinsic unit normal;
    we'd rather calculate with a specific parametrization.
    In an arbitrary parametrization,
    <m>da = |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v| du dv</m>.
    Then we perform a change of variables on the integral in the definition.
    <me>
      \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot \frac{\sigma u \times \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|} |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v| du dv = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot (\sigma_u \times \sigma_v) du dv
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the line integral,
    this is independent of the parametrization since it is equal
    (by change of variables)
    to the intrinsic defintion.

    Flux measures how much of the vector field passes through the surface.
    This is mostly easily seen for fluids if we think of the surface as a net.
    In this case the flux is exactly the amount of fluid passing through the net per unit time.
    For fields of force, the interpretation is slightly less obvious.
    However, flux will still matter a great deal for calculations involving forces.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>F(x,y,z) = (0,0,k)</m> is a constant vertical flow with the same flow rate.
        We can think of this flowing through a vertical pipe with radius <m>a</m> around the <m>z</m> axis by restricting the field to the domain where <m>x^2 + y^2 \leq a</m>.
        The surface is a cross-section of the pipe,
        which we can parametrize as
        <m>\sigma(r,\theta) = (r \cos \theta,
        r \sin \theta )</m> for <m>(r,\theta) \in [0,a] \times [0,2\pi]</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\sigma_r \amp  = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta, 0)</mrow>
          <mrow>\sigma_\theta \amp  = (-r \sin \theta, r \cos \theta, 0)</mrow>
          <mrow>\sigma_r \times \sigma_\theta \amp  = (0, 0, r)</mrow>
          <mrow>\int_\sigma F \cdot dA \amp  = \int_0^a \int_0^{2\pi} k r d\theta dr</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{2\pi a^2}{2} = \pi a^2 k = (\pi a^2) k</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\pi a^2</m> is the cross-sectional area and <m>k</m> is the rate of flow,
        so we have a uniform rate of volume of water flowing through the pipe per unit time.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

    <statement>
      <p>
        We could ask the same question with a different flow, one which is not uniform.
        Consider somthing like this, still moving vertically, but with variable speed.
        <md>
          <mrow>F(x,y,z) \amp  = \left( 0, 0, \frac{k (a^2 - x^2 - y^2)}{a^2} \right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\int_\sigma F \cdot dA \amp  = \int_0^a \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{k(a^2-r^2)}{a^2} r d\theta dr</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{2\pi k}{a^2} \int_0^a a^2r - r^3 dr</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{2\pi k}{a^2} \left. \left( \frac{a^2 r^2}{2} - \frac{r^2}{4} \right) \right|_0^a</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{2\pi k}{a^2} \left(\frac{a^4}{2} - \frac{a^4}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi k a^2}{2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is half the original flux.
        The lower rate of flow is justified since the fluid speed goes to zero near the edge of the pipe.

        We can also consider a turbulent flow.

        Consider a paddle with a roughly rectangular cross section 15cm wide and 30cm tall.
        Say it moves through the water in the <m>z</m> direction with speed <m>v</m>.
        We can reinterpret the situation by letting the water move with field
        <m>F = (0,0,v)</m> in which the paddle is stationary.
        We can think of the force the paddle causes in terms of the flux of this field through the paddle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we can perform a paddle stroke directly perpendicular to the direction of movement or at an angle <m>\theta</m>.
        Our question is: how does our forward force
        (hence flux)
        vary due to <m>\theta</m>?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the paddle is angled at angle <m>\theta</m>,
        then it is represented as a surface with normal <m>(\sin \theta, 0, \cos \theta)</m>.
        Therefore <m>F \cdot N = v \cos \theta</m>.
        <me>
          \int_\sigma F \cdot N dA = \int_D V \cos \theta dA = v \cos \theta \int \sigma 1 dv = 450 v \cos \theta
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the perpendicular force or <m>450v</m>,
        we just multiply by <m>\cos \theta</m>.
