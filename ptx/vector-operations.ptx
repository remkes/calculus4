  <title>Vector Operations on Vector Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall the gradient <m>\nabla f</m> of a scalar field <m>f</m>.
      It's useful to recall the definition of the operator <m>\nabla</m>.
      (stated in <m>\RR^3</m> for convenience).
      <me>
        \nabla = \left( \frac{\del}{\del x}, \frac{\del}{\del y}, \frac{\del}{\del z} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f</m> is a scalar field,
      then the gradient <m>\nabla f</m> is a <em>vector field</em>
      describing the direction of greatest change.
      We didn't investigate it's propreties as a vector field in Calculus III, but it was the first vector field we used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are new operators we can define using <m>\nabla</m> on vector fields <m>F</m>.
      <m>\nabla</m> operates a vector,
      since is has components which are differential operators.
      Therefore, we use vector notation involving <m>\nabla</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F : \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a vector field.
          The <term>curl</term> of <m>F</m> is defined as the the cross product of <m>\nabla</m> and <m>F</m>.
          Note that this outputs a new vector field, not a scalar field.
          <me>
            \nabla \times F = \left( \frac{\del F_3}{\del y} - \frac{\del F_2}{\del z}, \frac{\del F_1}{\del z} - \frac{\del F_3}{\del x}, \frac{\del F_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del F_1}{\del y}, \right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Curl measures the tendency of the vector field to cause
      <em>local</em> rotation.
      If we think of the vector field as a fluid flow and if we drop an object in the fluid,
      it will flow along the integral curves of the vector field.
      However, as it flows along, it may also start spinning about its own axis.
      Curl measure the tendency of the vector field to cause such a spin.
      (This is very different from global rotation.
      The paths of rotation themselves may be circular without actually causing the object itself to spin.
      Likewise, the paths can be totally straight but still cause rotation.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector field with zero curl is called
          <term>irrotational</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>F(x,y,z) = (y,0,0)</m>.
          This is a field which moves objects in the <m>x</m> direction,
          but the speed of movement varies with the <m>y</m> coordinate.
          The curl is <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,-1)</m>.
          This field causes a clockwise rotation about the <m>z</m> axis;
          as particles in the fluid move in the <m>x</m> direction,
          they start spinning around a vertical axis.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a vector field in any dimension.
          The <term>divergence</term> of <m>F</m> is the dot product <m>\nabla \cdot F</m>.
          Note that this outputs a new scalar field, not a vector field.
          <me>
            \nabla \cdot F = \frac{\del F_1}{\del x_1} + \frac{\del F_2}{\del x_2} + \ldots + \frac{\del F_n}{\del x_n}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The divergence measure the tendency of a vector field to diffuse.
      Thinking in terms of gaseous fluids,
      a positive divergence at a point means that the density of the gas is <em>decreasing</em>.
      Some directions of flow may be inward and some outward,
      but there is a net diffusion of the gas.
      If the divergence is negative,
      the density is <em>increasing</em>
      and there is a net gathering of the gas.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector where where the divergence is zero is called
          <term>incompressible</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Many liquids are incompressible,
      at least locally and under reasonable energy circumstances.
      Water is usually treated as an incompressible fluid.
      The major difference in fluid dynamics between gases and liquid is compressibility.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be is a scalar field <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>.
          It's <term>Laplacian</term> is the divergence of its gradient:
          <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \nabla^2 f</m>.
          Note that this outputs a scalar field.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The Laplacian was mentioned in the previous term,
      since the input and output are both scalar fields.
      However, the intermediate state
      (the gradient)
      is a vector field, and the second part of the operation
      (the divergence)
      is a vector operation.
      This persepctive of the Laplacian is quite useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Laplacian is very important for many differential equations in physics.
      As the divergence of the gradient field,
      it measures where the scalar field leads to a gathering or spreading.
      In a potential energy field,
      it measures the sources (attractors) and repellors which generate the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two important differential equations introduced in Calculus III: the heat equation and the wave equation.
      Extending these DES to several dimensions uses the Laplacian.
      Recall the 1-variable and multi-variable versions of those two equations.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\del f}{\del t} \amp  = \alpha \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} \amp  = \alpha \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x^2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Replacing the 1-variable position derivative with a multivariable Laplacian extends these DEs to several variables.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\del f}{\del t} \amp  = \alpha \nabla^2 f</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} \amp  = \alpha \nabla^2 f</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've also seen the Laplacian in the Schr&#xf6;dinger equation and the Navier-Stokes equation as the space derivative term.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wave equation,
      if <m>\nabla^2 f = 0</m> then <m>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} = 0</m>.
      Therefore, <m>f</m> has, at most,
      a linear dependence in <m>t</m>.
      Since the dependence in <m>x</m> is often sinusoidal,
      a common solution here is a standing wave or a wave with constant velocity.
      This (among other,
      more confusing reasons) leads to the terminology of harmonic functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A scalar field <m>f</m> is <term>harmonic</term> if <m>\nabla^2 f = 0</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The harmonic condition is a very restrictive condition.
      In particular,
      harmonic functions satify a maximum modulus principle:
      if <m>f</m> has an strict extrema in an open set,
      then it has a point with non-zero Laplacian and cannot be harmonic.
      Therefore, the extrema of <m>f</m> must always come on the boundary of any open set.
      In complex analysis,
      all differentiable (holomorphic) functions are harmonic;
      this fact leads to very different behaviour between real and complex differentiable functions.

      All uses of <m>\nabla</m> are linear.

      In the previous identity
      (and similar identities),
      pay careful attention to which outputs are scalar fields and which are vector fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\nabla</m> is a differential operator,
      it doesn't distribute over multiplication.
      However, there are several generalizations of the Leibniz rule.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a scalar field on <m>\RR^3</m> and let <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> be vector fields on <m>\RR^3</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\nabla \cdot (F \times G) \amp  = (\nabla \times F) \cdot G - F \cdot (\nabla \times G)</mrow>
            <mrow>\nabla \cdot (fF) \amp  = f (\nabla \cdot F) + (\nabla f) \cdot F</mrow>
            <mrow>\nabla \times (fF) \amp  = f (\nabla \times F) + (\nabla f) \times F</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In the first Leibniz rule we have a difference instead of the expected sum.
      In general versions of the Leibniz rule,
      this negative sign is quite common.
      Many versions of the rule have <m>(-1)^k</m> for some <m>k</m>,
      showing that it is equally easy to have a sum or difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two important results about composition of vector operations.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a scalar field on <m>\RR^3</m> and <m>F</m> a vector field on <m>\RR^3</m>.
          Then <m>\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0</m>:
          the curl of a gradient is zero.
          Also, <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times F) = 0</m>:
          the divergence of a curl is zero.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This proposition is established by calculating all the terms and using the compatibility of order in mixed second partial derivatives.
      The proofs are left as exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition is also a glimpse of a very general result in analysis.
      If we work with the right definitions, applying the same
      (or similar)
      differential operator twice in a row should give the zero operator.
      Obviously, this isn't always true:
      partial derivatives certainly don't satisfy this,
      and even for <m>\nabla</m>,
      <m>\nabla \cdot \nabla f \neq 0</m> for a general scalar field.
      Near the end of these notes,
      we will give a general structure for understanding why differential operators should compose to zero.

          This is a harmonic scalar field.
          In particular, it can have no extrema on an open set.
          Values approach <m>-\infty</m> near the origin and <m>\infty</m> as we get very far from the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (-z,x,-y)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (-1,1,1)</m>,
          so the vector field causes the same local rotation at all points,
          about the axis <m>(-1,1,1)</m>
          (as a local axis direction).
          <m>\nabla \cdot F = (0,0,0)</m>,
          so the flow is incompressible.
          This is a good field to potentially model a liquid flow that induces a particular local rotation everywhere.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (x^2,y^2,z^2)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,0)</m>,
          so the field is irrotational.
          The divergence is <m>\nabla \cdot F = (2x +2y+2z)</m>.
          In the positive octant, the flow accelerates away from the origin,
          so the rate of difussion increases away from the origin In other octants,
          we may have negative divergence,
          reflecting the fact that the local vector field directions are always positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (-y,x,0)</m>
          (which should be fairly familiar by this time).
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,2)</m>,
          which shows the creation of local rotation about the <m>z</m> axis.
          Note that this is local rotation,
          which is seperate from the global rotation of the integral curves about the origin.
          Also, <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>,
          so the flow is incompressible.
          As the flow spins around, it neither collects or diffuses anywhere.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (\sin x, \cos y, 0)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,0)</m>,
          so the flow is irrotational.
          This is interesting, given the trigonometric term;
          trigonometry might cause us to expect spin.
          <m>\nabla \cdot F = \cos x - \sin y</m>,
          so there are various areas of diffusion and collection.
          The trigonometric term here causes diffusion/collection,
          not rotation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = \left( \frac{1}{x+y}, \frac{1}{x+y}, 0 \right)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = \left(0,0, \frac{-1}{(x-y)^2} - \frac{-1}{(x+y)^2} \right)</m>:
          this curl is always negative and always about the <m>z</m> axis.
          <m>\nabla \cdot F = \frac{-1}{(x+y)^2} + \frac{1}{(x-y)^2}</m>:
          therefore, <m>F</m> collects when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are dissimilar and diffuses when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are quite close.
        </p>
