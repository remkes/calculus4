  <title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
  <p>
    Having done all this work, we can state the final result.
    This is called Stokes' Theorem,
    but it generalizes Stokes' Green's, Gauss', and all the fundamental theorems we have so far.
    It is one theorem that clearly,
    succintly and elegantly describe the relationships between integration,
    differentiation and boundary operators,
    all in the language of differential forms.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a oriented smooth k-dimensional manifold in <m>\RR^n</m> with boundary <m>\del S</m> a piecewise-smooth oriented k-1-dimensional manifold with compatible orientation.
        Let <m>\omega</m> be a degree k-1 differential form on <m>\del S</m> with <m>C^2</m> coefficients which can be extended to a neighbourhood of <m>S</m>
        (so that <m>d\omega</m> is a degree k form on <m>S</m> with <m>C^1</m> coefficents.)
        Under all these assumption, the following statement is true.
        <me>
          \int_S d\omega = \int_{\del S} \omega
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    That's the whole theorem.
    Let's special to various dimensions to see how it extends our previous results.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>k=1</m> then we have <m>\omega =f</m> a scalar field,
    <m>\gamma</m> a curve and <m>d\omega</m> had coefficients which were <m>\nabla f</m>,
    so the theorem turns into the fundamental theorem for line integrals.
    <me>
      \int_\gamma \nabla f = \int_\gamma d \omega = \int_{\del \gamma} \omega = \int_{\del \gamma} f = f(\gamma(b)) - f(\gamma(a))
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Integration over a zero dimensional set,
    such as the endpoint of a curve, is just evaluation.
    The sign (positive or negative) is given by the orientation.
    If the curve parametrized just a integral in the real line,
    we recover the fundamental theorem of calculus from Calculus I.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>k=2</m>,
    then <m>\omega = f_1 dx + f_2 dy + f_3 dz</m> a 1-form,
    <m>\sigma</m> is a surface, and <m>\del \sigma</m> is a closed curve.
    The exterior derivative <m>d\omega</m> has coeficients which would be the coefficients of
    <m>\nabla \times F</m> is <m>F = (f_1,f_2,f_3)</m> were a vector field.
    The general Stokes' theorem turns into its previous defined vector-field version,
    which was also called Stokes' theorem. (We already argued that Green's theorem was just a special case of this vector-field Stokes' theorem).
    <me>
      \int_\sigma dw = \int_{\del \sigma} \omega \implies \int_S \nabla \times (f_1, f_2, f_3) = \int_{\del \sigma} (f_1, f_2, f_3)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, if <m>k-3</m>,
    then we have <m>\omega = f_1 dy \wedge dz + f_2 dz \wedge dx + f_3 dx \wedge dy</m>,
    <m>S</m> is a solid region and <m>\del S</m> is a closed surface.
    The component of the 3-form <m>dw</m> is the scalar field given by
    <m>\nabla \cdot F</m> is <m>F = (f_1,f_2,f_3)</m> were a vector field.
    Stokes' theorem recovers Gauss' theorem.
    <me>
      \int_S dw = \int_{\del S} \omega \implies \int_S \nabla \cdot (f_1, f_2, f_3) = \int_{\del S} (f_1, f_2, f_3)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way, using the general theorem for differential forms,
    we recover Gauss-Green-Stokes and the fundamental theorem of line integrals.
