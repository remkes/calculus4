  <title>Parametric Surfaces</title>
  <p>
    We've defined integrals of vector fields along arametric curves.
    However, parametric curves are only one dimensional objects. What
    does it mean to integrate a vector field over higher dimensional
    objects?
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector fields are not like scalar fields, where we can just
    integrate over regions of <m>\RR^3</m>. We take a hint from line
    integrals using parametric curves: we need parametric objects. We
    can define parametric objects in any dimension, though the theory
    gets more and more difficult with added dimensions. In this
    section we define parametric surfaces, which are the 2-dimensional
    analogue to parametric curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>[a,b]</m> is an interval on <m>\RR</m>, a curve was a
    function on that interval into a vector space.
    <me>
      \gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curve is a <em>continuous</em> (usually differentiable)
    function on the interval. For surfaces, we need two directions of
    freedom, so we start in <m>\RR^2</m> instead of <m>\RR</m>. We
    might start with intervals <m>I</m> in <m>\RR^2</m>, but we can be
    a bit more general.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>D \subset \RR^2</m> be a <term>simply connected</term>
        set. A parametric surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m> is a
        <term>continuous</term> (usually differentiable) function on
        <m>D</m> into a vector space.
        <me>
          \sigma: D \rightarrow \RR^3
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Like parametric curves, we visualize surfaces only by their
    outputs. The input set <m>D</m> isn't visualized; rather, it is
    thought of as the parameter space. The difference, compared to
    curves, is that we now have a 2-dimensional parameter space. This
    allows two independent directions of movement on the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to refine the previous definition a little bit: we want to
    avoid places where the surface has strange behaviour by insisting
    that the surface is <sq>smooth</sq>. Differentiability is
    required here, but the condition is actually a bit stronger. We
    need to think about tangents.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a curve <m>\gamma(t)</m>, the only derivative was the time
    derivative and <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> was the tangent. For a
    surface, let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be the coordinates in the
    region <m>D</m>. Then we have two partial derivatives:
    <m>\sigma_u = \frac{\del}{\del u} \sigma(u,v)</m> and <m>\sigma_v
    = \frac{\del}{\del v} \sigma (u,v)</m>. These are both tangents.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A parametric surface is called <term>smooth</term> if it has
        two (linearly) independent tangent directions at any point.
        Working in <m>\RR^3</m>, we can calculate <m>\sigma_u \times
        \sigma_v</m>. This is perpendicular to both tangents, so this
        direction should be normal to the surface. We will use that
        name, and call <m>\sigma_u \times \sigma_v</m> the
        <term>normal</term> to a smooth parametric surface.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The smoothness condition can be rephrased: the normal must never
    be zero. We will be using the normal extensively and zero normals
    will cause many problems. Therefore, from this point, we assume
    all surfaces are piece-wise smooth, with non-zero normals.
    Piece-wise is enough, since the cross-over sections will be
    lower-dimensions and thus can be ignored in integration. (For
    curves, we made implicit use of a similar convention that the
    tangent should never be the zero vector, though we didn't say so
    at the time.) Since we are using the cross-product, this
    definition on applies to <m>\RR^3</m>. For the rest of this
    entire chapter, we will exclusive be working with parametric
    surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m>.

        If <m>f(x,y)</m> is a 2-variable function on a

        can use <m>D</m> as the domain and <m>\sigma (u,v) =
        (u,v,f(u,v))</m> is the graph expressed as a parametric
        surface.
