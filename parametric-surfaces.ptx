  <title>Parametric Surfaces</title>
  <p>
    We've defined integrals of vector fields along arametric curves.
    However, parametric curves are only one dimensional objects.
    What does it mean to integrate a vector field over higher dimensional objects?
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector fields are not like scalar fields,
    where we can just integrate over regions of <m>\RR^3</m>.
    We take a hint from line integrals using parametric curves:
    we need parametric objects.
    We can define parametric objects in any dimension,
    though the theory gets more and more difficult with added dimensions.
    In this section we define parametric surfaces,
    which are the 2-dimensional analogue to parametric curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>[a,b]</m> is an interval on <m>\RR</m>,
    a curve was a function on that interval into a vector space.
    <me>
      \gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curve is a <em>continuous</em>
    (usually differentiable)
    function on the interval.
    For surfaces, we need two directions of freedom,
    so we start in <m>\RR^2</m> instead of <m>\RR</m>.
    We might start with intervals <m>I</m> in <m>\RR^2</m>,
    but we can be a bit more general.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>D \subset \RR^2</m> be a
        <term>simply connected</term> set.
        A parametric surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m> is a <term>continuous</term>
        (usually differentiable)
        function on <m>D</m> into a vector space.
        <me>
          \sigma: D \rightarrow \RR^3
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Like parametric curves, we visualize surfaces only by their outputs.
    The input set <m>D</m> isn't visualized;
    rather, it is thought of as the parameter space.
    The difference, compared to curves,
    is that we now have a 2-dimensional parameter space.
    This allows two independent directions of movement on the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to refine the previous definition a little bit:
    we want to avoid places where the surface has strange behaviour by insisting that the surface is <sq>smooth</sq>.
    Differentiability is required here,
    but the condition is actually a bit stronger.
    We need to think about tangents.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a curve <m>\gamma(t)</m>,
    the only derivative was the time derivative and <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> was the tangent.
    For a surface,
    let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be the coordinates in the region <m>D</m>.
    Then we have two partial derivatives:
    <m>\sigma_u = \frac{\del}{\del u} \sigma(u,v)</m> and <m>\sigma_v = \frac{\del}{\del v} \sigma (u,v)</m>.
    These are both tangents.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A parametric surface is called <term>smooth</term>
        if it has two (linearly) independent tangent directions at any point.
        Working in <m>\RR^3</m>, we can calculate <m>\sigma_u \times \sigma_v</m>.
        This is perpendicular to both tangents,
        so this direction should be normal to the surface.
        We will use that name, and call
        <m>\sigma_u \times \sigma_v</m> the <term>normal</term>
        to a smooth parametric surface.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The smoothness condition can be rephrased:
    the normal must never be zero.
    We will be using the normal extensively and zero normals will cause many problems.
    Therefore, from this point,
    we assume all surfaces are piece-wise smooth, with non-zero normals.
    Piece-wise is enough,
    since the cross-over sections will be lower-dimensions and thus can be ignored in integration.
    (For curves,
    we made implicit use of a similar convention that the tangent should never be the zero vector,
    though we didn't say so at the time.)
    Since we are using the cross-product,
    this definition on applies to <m>\RR^3</m>.
    For the rest of this entire chapter,
    we will exclusive be working with parametric surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x,y)</m> is a 2-variable function on a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>,
        it's graph is a surface.
        We can use <m>D</m> as the domain and
        <m>\sigma (u,v) = (u,v,f(u,v))</m> is the graph expressed as a parametric surface.
