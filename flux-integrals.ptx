    In addition to integrating scalars along surfaces, we also want to
    integrate vector fields. For the definition, we again look at
    line integrals. We took a dot product with the tangent to the
    curve to measure how much the field acts with or against the
    motion of the curve. For surfaces, we also take a dot product,
    but now with the normal of the surface. By doing so, we are
    measuring how much the vector field passes through the surface: if
    the dot product is large, the field direction is similar to the
    normal and almost perpendicular to the surface. If the dot
    product is small, the field moves almost in parallel with the
    surface, moving across it instead of through it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We used the dot product with the unit tangent to calculate a line
    integral.
    <me>
      \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds = \int_{\gamma} F \cdot T ds = \int_a^b
      F(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We need something similar to the unit tangent to calculate
    integrals of fields over surfaces.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> be a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m>
        defined over a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>. The
        <term>unit normal</term> of the surface is the vector
        <m>\frac{\sigma_u \times \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times
        \sigma_v|}</m>. (Our convention that the normal is never zero
        helps to avoid division by zero in this definition.)

        Let <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> be a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m>
        defined over a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>. Let <m>F</m>
        be a vector field defined on a neighbourhood of the surface.
        The <term>flux integral</term> is defined to be the following
        integral.
        <me>
          \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA = \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first notation is more complete, but the second notation
        is conventional.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As with curve, we don't want to calculate with the intrinsic unit
    normal; we'd rather calculate with a specific parametrization. In
    an arbitrary parametrization, <m>da = |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|
    du dv</m>. Then we perform a change of variables on the integral
    in the definition.
    <me>
      \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot
      \frac{\sigma u \times \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|}
      |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v| du dv = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot
      (\sigma_u \times \sigma_v) du dv
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the line integral, this is independent of the parametrization
    since it is equal (by change of variables) to the intrinsic
    defintion.
  </p>

    Flux measures how much of the vector field passes through the
    surface. This is mostly easily seen for fluids if we think of the
    surface as a net. In this case the flux is exactly the amount of
    fluid passing through the net per unit time. For fields of force,
    the interpretation is slightly less obvious. However, flux will
    still matter a great deal for calculations involving forces.

    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>F(x,y,z) = (0,0,k)</m> is a constant vertical flow with the
        same flow rate. We can think of this flowing through a
        vertical pipe with radius <m>a</m> around the <m>z</m> axis by
        restricting the field to the domain where <m>x^2 + y^2 \leq
        a</m>. The surface is a cross-section of the pipe, which we
        can parametrize as <m>\sigma(r,\theta) = (r \cos \theta, r
        \sin \theta )</m> for <m>(r,\theta) \in [0,a] \times
        [0,2\pi]</m>.

        <m>\pi a^2</m> is the cross-sectional area and <m>k</m> is the
        rate of flow, so we have a uniform rate of volume of water
        flowing through the pipe per unit time.

        We could ask the same question with a different flow, one
        which is not uniform. Consider somthing like this, still
        moving vertically, but with variable speed.

        This is half the original flux. The lower rate of flow is
        justified since the fluid speed goes to zero near the edge of
        the pipe.

        Consider a paddle with a roughly rectangular cross section
        15cm wide and 30cm tall. Say it moves through the water in
        the <m>z</m> direction with speed <m>v</m>. We can
        reinterpret the situation by letting the water move with field
        <m>F = (0,0,v)</m> in which the paddle is stationary. We can
        think of the force the paddle causes in terms of the flux of
        this field through the paddle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we can perform a paddle stroke directly perpendicular to
        the direction of movement or at an angle <m>\theta</m>. Our
        question is: how does our forward force (hence flux) vary due
        to <m>\theta</m>?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the paddle is angled at angle <m>\theta</m>, then it is
        represented as a surface with normal <m>(\sin \theta, 0, \cos
        \theta)</m>. Therefore <m>F \cdot N = v \cos \theta</m>.
        <me>
          \int_\sigma F \cdot N dA = \int_D V \cos \theta dA = v \cos
          \theta \int \sigma 1 dv = 450 v \cos \theta
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the perpendicular force or <m>450v</m>, we just
        multiply by <m>\cos \theta</m>.
