  <title>The Indefinite Integral</title>
  <p>
    In single variable calculus,
    the integral is defined as a limit of approximating Riemann sums.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a continuous function.
        If we partion the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> equal pieces of size
        <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m> and <m>x_k^*</m> is any element in the <m>k</m>th partition,
        the integral of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> is defined to be
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*) \frac{b-a}{n}
        </me>.

    Recall the fundamental theorem of calculus.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a continuous function.
        Then if <m>F(x)</m> is any antiderivative of <m>f</m> (i.e.
        <m>F^\prime(x) = f(x)</m>),
        we can evaluate the definite integral using the antiderivative.
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several version of the fundamental theorem,
        but all say the same thing: (single-variable) derivatives and integrals are inverse processes.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    We used the indefinite integral
    <m>\int f dx</m> to stand for <em>all</em>
    anti-derivatives of the single-variable function.
    Is there a multivariable version of this anti-derivative?
    Calculus III tried to extend the derivative to multi-variable functions.
    The result was a collection of construction:
    partial derivatives, tangent (hyper-)planes,
    gradients and the Jacobian matrix.
    However, none of these notions of the derivative gave a new multi-variable funciton.
    Therefore, there isn't a nice notion of anti-derivative:
    going back doesn't make sense,
    since going forward led to more complicated constructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can, however, take indefinite integrals in one variable,
    much like partial derivatives.
    If <m>f(x,y,z)</m> is a multivariable continuous function,
    then the following three integrals are the counterparts of partial differentiation.
    In each of the following we pretend the other two variables are constant;
    only the variable indicated by the infintesimal term is non-constant.
    <md>
      <mrow>\int f(x,y,z) dx \amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\int f(x,y,z) dy \amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\int f(x,y,z) dz \amp</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our best extention of the fundamental theorem is just a version involving the partial derivatives.
    <md>
      <mrow>\int \frac{\del}{\del x} f(x,y,z) dx \amp  = f(x,y,z) + g(y,z)</mrow>
      <mrow>\int \frac{\del}{\del y} f(x,y,z) dy \amp  = f(x,y,z) + g(x,z)</mrow>
      <mrow>\int \frac{\del}{\del z} f(x,y,z) dz \amp  = f(x,y,z) + g(x,y)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the <sq>constants of integration</sq> now may involve the other variables.
    When we do single variable integration or partial differentiation,
    we pretend all the other variables are constant;
    therefore, the constant term can include those variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will discover much deeper and more interesting extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus later in this course.
    However, they will come from entirely new directions.
    For now, this is as far as we can extend the fundamental theorem.
    Nothing more can be said about the indefinite integral;
    it is not used for multivariable functions.
