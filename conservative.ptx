  <title>Conservative Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    An important class of vector fields are gradients of scalar fields.
    The most common case is a potential energy scalar field,
    where <m>f</m> measures potential energy.
    A principle of motion in physics states that particles will seek to lower their potential energy in the most efficient way possible.
    That is, they will move in the direction of greatest descent of potential energy.
    That movement is precisely along the integral curves of the vector field <m>\nabla f</m>.
    So, if we try to explain a physical situation by a potential energy field,
    then the movement of particles is equivalent to finding integral curves of <m>\nabla f</m>.
    Moreover, movement along these paths creates kinetic energy.
    The speed of movement can be determined by conservation of energy:
    the movement along the paths has speed and kinetic energy gained at exactly the same rate as potential energy is lost.
    Conservation of energy explains the terminology of this section.

    <statement>

        Let <m>f</m> be a scalar field.
        Then field <m>\nabla f</m> created from a potential energy field is called a
        <term>conservative vector field</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If we are given a general vector field <m>F</m>,
    we would like to check whether or not it is conservative.
    We have the identity <m>\nabla \times \nabla f=0</m>,
    which shows that all conservative fields are irrotational.
    Is the converse true?
    We need a technical definition before we can answer this question.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>U</m> be an open subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        <m>U</m> is called <term>path connected</term>
        if there is a parametric curve connecting any two points <m>a,
        b \in U</m>.
        (Recall in our definition in Calculus III that parametric curves are always continuous.)
        If <m>U</m> is path connected,
        it is also called <term>simply connected</term>
        if any closed path (a path which starts and ends at the same spot) can be contracted down to a point. (Think of the path as a loop in a rope,
        and contraction as pulling the rope so that the loop disappears.
        This needs to happen in such a way that all the intermediate steps are still paths in the set <m>U</m>).
      </p>
    </statement>

  <p>
    Na&#xef;vely, a simply connected set has no holes in it.
    A solid cylinder is simply connected.
    However, the hollow cylinder is not,
    since a loop around the cylinder can never be contracted.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>U</m> be a simply connected open set in <m>\RR^3</m> and let
        <m>F: U \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a differentiable vector field Then <m>F</m> is conservative on <m>U</m> if an only if <m>\nabla \times F = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    The condition <m>\nabla \times F</m> works both ways under a reasonable condition for the domain of the vector field.
    We can check if a vector is conservative by taking the curl;
    if the curl is zero, it is conservative.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>F</m> is conservative, then there exists at least one
    (in fact, infinitely many!)
    scalar fields <m>f</m> with <m>F = \nabla f</m>.
    This <m>f</m>, inspired by the physics situation,
    is called a (scalar) potential for <m>F</m>.
    If <m>f</m> is a potential energy field,
    <m>F</m> is the associated field of force.
    Usually, both the potential energy and force fields are defined per unit mass or charge,
    so that they can act on any mass or charge present in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do we calculate <m>f</m>?
    The equation <m>F = \nabla f</m> can be expanded.
    <md>
      <mrow>F_1 \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del x}</mrow>
      <mrow>F_2 \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del y}</mrow>
      <mrow>F_3 \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del z}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can integrate each of these equations.
    We have to be careful with the <sq>constants</sq>:
    in each integral,
    the constants can be functions of both of the remaining variables.
    <md>
      <mrow>f \amp  = \int F_1 dx + g_1(y,z)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int F_2 dy + g_2(x,z)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \int F_3 dz + g_3(x,y)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding <m>f</m> amounts to finding a scalar field that fits this system.
    For reasonable <m>F</m>, this isn't too terrible.
    We expect a family of solutions:
    since we are integrating and there will be constants of integration introduced.
    Initial values can determine the constant to give a unique potential.
    The constants here make sense:
    potential energy is always a relative measure,
    so we have to set a base level of potential energy.
    Please note: energy is always relative!
    Unlike mass and charge, energy is not an intrinsic measure.
    Energy is a fiction, but a very useful fiction for explaning motion.
