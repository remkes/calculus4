    If we interpret a vector field as a fluid flow,
    imagine a bouyant object floating in the flow.
    Moving with the flow, what path would the bouyant object take?
    More mathematically, given the arrows of direction of a vector field,
    can we find parametric curves
    <m>\gamma(t)</m> which follow these arrows?
    What does follow mean?

        Let <m>F: S \rightarrow \RR^m</m> be a vector field on a region <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>.
        If there exists a family
        (depending on some variable <m>a \in \RR^k</m>)
        of parametric curves <m>\gamma_a</m> such that,
        over the whole family, <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = F</m>,
        then these parametric curves are called the
        <term>integral curves</term> of the vector field.
        That is, the <term>tangents</term>
        of the parametric curves are the same as the vector field everywhere.
        Equivalently, a parametric curve
        <m>\gamma(t)</m> is an integral curve for a vector field <m>F</m> if <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = F(\gamma(t))</m>.

        Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y) = (-y,x)</m>,
        as shown in <xref ref="figure-vector-field3">Figure</xref>,
        with its integral curves.
        These integral curves of <m>F(x,y) = (-y,x)</m> aren't surprising.
        Looking just at the vector fields,
        we can clearly tell that the fluid is travelling in a circular paths.
        Mathematically, the circles are curves
        <m>\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)</m> for a parameter <m>a > 0</m>.
        We can calculate <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = (-a\sin t, a \cos t) = (-y, x)</m>.
        In terms of the curve coordinates,
        these tangents are exactly the vector field.

        The curves <m>\gamma(t) = (ae^t,be^t)</m> where <m>a,b \in \RR</m> are integral curves.
        They have <m>x = ae^t</m> and <m>y = be^t</m>,
        and we can calculate tangents:
        <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = (ae^t, be^t) = (x,y)</m>.

    Integral curves are a very powerful conceptual tool.
    However, they are usually very hard to calculate and most examples are beyond the scope of this course.
    However, there will be a few we can attempt.
    I'll describe the general process in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    If <m>F = (F_1,F_2,F_3)</m> is a vector field and
    <m>\gamma(t) = (\gamma_1, \gamma_2,\gamma_3)</m> is a parametric curve,
    then <m>\gamma</m> is an integral curve if it satisfies the following system.
    <md>
      <mrow>\gamma_1^\prime(t) \amp  = F_1(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3)</mrow>
      <mrow>\gamma_2^\prime(t) \amp  = F_2(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3)</mrow>
      <mrow>\gamma_3^\prime(t) \amp  = F_3(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a system
    (generally non-linear)
    of three differential equations in three functions, the <m>\gamma_i</m>.
    Even if it is linear,
    this is still a difficult system to solve, if not impossible.
    Even a simple field such as
    <m>F(x,y,z) = (y,z,x)</m> leads to a difficult system.
    <md>
      <mrow>\gamma_1^\prime \amp  = \gamma_2</mrow>
      <mrow>\gamma_2^\prime \amp  = \gamma_3</mrow>
      <mrow>\gamma_3^\prime \amp  = \gamma_1</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, we have no method for approaching this system.
    The solution would be a function which is its own third derivative,
    and we are not currently aware of any such functions.
    However, there are some approach examples with reasonable systems of equations.

    <statement>

        Let <m>F = (x,y,z)</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\gamma_1^\prime \amp  = \gamma_1 \implies \gamma_1(t) = ae^t</mrow>
          <mrow>\gamma_2^\prime \amp  = \gamma_2 \implies \gamma_2(t) = be^t</mrow>
          <mrow>\gamma_3^\prime \amp  = \gamma_3 \implies \gamma_3(t) = ce^t</mrow>
        </md>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F = (1,2x,3y)</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\gamma_1^\prime \amp  = 1</mrow>
          <mrow>\gamma_2^\prime \amp  = 2\gamma_1</mrow>

        This can be solved iteratively.

          <mrow>\gamma_1 \amp  = \int 1 dt = t + a</mrow>
          <mrow>\gamma_2 \amp  = 2\int \gamma_1 dt = \int 2t + 2a dt = t^2 + 2at + b</mrow>
