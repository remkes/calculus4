  <title>Iterated Integrals</title>
  <p>
    The previous section gave us a good definition,
    but how do we actually calculate these integrals?
    Let <m>I = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> be an interval in <m>\RR^2</m>.
    The infintesimal piece of area <m>dA</m> in the integral can be thought of as the product <m>dx dy</m> of infinitesimal pieces of length.
    Separating <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
    we can interate the integral,
    first working in <m>x</m> and then in <m>y</m>.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \int_c^d \left[ \int_a^b f(x,y) dy \right] dx
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We work from the inside out:
    the infinitesimal piece <m>dx</m> or <m>dy</m> that is closest to the function acts first.
    Its bounds are written on the right, closest to the function.
    That integral is a single-variable integration,
    pretending that the other variables are constant,
    as we did with partial derivatives.
    Then, once the firstintegration is finished,
    we proceed outward to the next integral.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same works in higher dimensions:
    we just iterate through the variables.
    In <m>\RR^3</m>, over the interval
    <m>I = [a_1,b_1] \times [a_2,b_2] \times [a_3,b_3]</m> with three iterations.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y,z) dV = \int_{a_3}^{b_3} \left[ \int_{a_2}^{b_2} \left[ \int_{a_1}^{b_2} f(x,y,z) dx \right] dy \right] dz
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that we always have to match the bounds of integration with the correct infinitesimal piece,
    working from the inside out.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might ask, at this point,
    what happens when we change the order?
    We have to choose an order for these iterated integrals.
    Fubini's Theorem tells us that we are able to choose the order.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm-fubini">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f: I \rightarrow \RR</m> is an integrable function on an interval,
        then the iterated integral is independent of the choice or order.
        Any ordering of the variables will result in the same value.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    In working with iterated integrals,
    we must be careful with the evaluation if each integral.
    It's easy to confuse the variable of integration and substitue for the wrong variables.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the interval <m>I = [0,1] \times[3,6]</m> and the function <m>f(x,y) = e^x + e^y</m>.
        In this example, I've carefully labelled the bound to remind myself which variable to replace.

        Consider the interval <m>I = [-1,1] \times [-2,2]</m> and the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2y^3</m>.

        Just to check, we could change the order.

    We notice that the second calculation is actually a bit simplier,
    since we find the zero term earlier in the process.
    Often, one order of variables leads to an easier calculation.
    Fubini's theorem lets us chose any order,
    so we try to chose the order that has the easiest calculations.
    Of course, the right choice isn't always obvious before we start doing the calculations.

        If we have a integrable function on
        <m>I = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> with the special form
        <m>f(x,y) = g(x) h(y)</m> for some single variable functions <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>,
        then we call <m>f(x,y)</m> seperable.
        The integral seperates entirely into two single variable integrals.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_I f(x,y) dx \amp  = \int_a^b \int_c^d g(x) h(y) dy dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_a^b g(x) \left[ \int_c^d h(y) dy \right] dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \left[ \int_c^d h(y) dy \right] \left[ \int_a^b g(x) dx \right]</mrow>

      <p>
        The operations above are justified because the pieces which we move in and out of a integral do not involve that variable of integration.
        In this way,
        we can seperate the integral into two single variable integrals.
        This kind of seperation of variables is a very important technique in differential equations.

        Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)^3}}</m> on the interval <m>I = [0,1] \times [0,1]</m>.
        We would like to try to integrate this function over this interval,
        but there is a problem.
        At one corner of the interval,
        <m>(0,0)</m>, the function is undefined.
        As we approach that corner, the function diverges to infinity.
        Is the integral still defined?
        We can use a limit in the bounds,
        in the last step, to investigate.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_I f(x,y) dx \amp  = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)^3}} dx dy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^1 \left. \frac{x}{y^2 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \right|_0^1 dy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{y^2 \sqrt{1 + y^2}} dy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{y^2 \sqrt{1 + y^2}} dy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+} \left. \frac{-\sqrt{1+y^2}}{y} \right|_a^1 = \frac{-\sqrt{2}}{1} + \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\sqrt{1+a^2}}{a} = \infty</mrow>

        This integral diverges;
        the volume under the curve grows to infinity as we include more and more of the interval approaching the point <m>(0,0)</m>.
        This is an improper integral,
        where the function has an asymptote at the edge of the domain of integration.
        In general, we treat improper integrals as we did before:
        we use limits approaching the edges of the domain and calculate the limit of the integral.
