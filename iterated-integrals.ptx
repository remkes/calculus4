  <title>Iterated Integrals</title>
  <p>
    The previous section gave us a good definition, but how do we
    actually calculate these integrals? Let <m>I = [a,b] \times
    [c,d]</m> be an interval in <m>\RR^2</m>. The infintesimal piece
    of area <m>dA</m> in the integral can be thought of as the product
    <m>dx dy</m> of infinitesimal pieces of length. Separating
    <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we can interate the integral, first working
    in <m>x</m> and then in <m>y</m>.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \int_c^d \left[ \int_a^b f(x,y) dy \right]
      dx
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We work from the inside out: the infinitesimal piece <m>dx</m> or
    <m>dy</m> that is closest to the function acts first. Its bounds
    are written on the right, closest to the function. That integral
    is a single-variable integration, pretending that the other
    variables are constant, as we did with partial derivatives. Then,
    once the firstintegration is finished, we proceed outward to the
    next integral.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same works in higher dimensions: we just iterate through the
    variables. In <m>\RR^3</m>, over the interval <m>I = [a_1,b_1]
    \times [a_2,b_2] \times [a_3,b_3]</m> with three iterations.
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y,z) dV = \int_{a_3}^{b_3} \left[ \int_{a_2}^{b_2}
      \left[ \int_{a_1}^{b_2} f(x,y,z) dx \right] dy \right] dz
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that we always have to match the bounds of integration with
    the correct infinitesimal piece, working from the inside out.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might ask, at this point, what happens when we change the
    order? We have to choose an order for these iterated integrals.
    Fubini's Theorem tells us that we are able to choose the order.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm-fubini">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f: I \rightarrow \RR</m> is an integrable function on an
        interval, then the iterated integral is independent of the
        choice or order. Any ordering of the variables will result in
        the same value.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    In working with iterated integrals, we must be careful with the
    evaluation if each integral. It's easy to confuse the variable of
    integration and substitue for the wrong variables.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the interval <m>I = [0,1] \times[3,6]</m> and the
        function <m>f(x,y) = e^x + e^y</m>. In this example, I've
        carefully labelled the bound to remind myself which variable
        to replace.

    We notice that the second calculation is actually a bit simplier,
    since we find the zero term earlier in the process. Often, one
    order of variables leads to an easier calculation. Fubini's
    theorem lets us chose any order, so we try to chose the order that
    has the easiest calculations. Of course, the right choice isn't
    always obvious before we start doing the calculations.

        some single variable functions <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>, then we
        call <m>f(x,y)</m> seperable. The integral seperates entirely
        into two single variable integrals.

        The operations above are justified because the pieces which we
        move in and out of a integral do not involve that variable of
        integration. In this way, we can seperate the integral into
        two single variable integrals. This kind of seperation of
        variables is a very important technique in differential
        equations.

        Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2 +
        y^2)^3}}</m> on the interval <m>I = [0,1] \times [0,1]</m>.
        We would like to try to integrate this function over this
        interval, but there is a problem. At one corner of the
        interval, <m>(0,0)</m>, the function is undefined. As we
        approach that corner, the function diverges to infinity. Is
        the integral still defined? We can use a limit in the bounds,
        in the last step, to investigate.

        This integral diverges; the volume under the curve grows to
        infinity as we include more and more of the interval
        approaching the point <m>(0,0)</m>. This is an improper
        integral, where the function has an asymptote at the edge of
        the domain of integration. In general, we treat improper
        integrals as we did before: we use limits approaching the
        edges of the domain and calculate the limit of the integral.
